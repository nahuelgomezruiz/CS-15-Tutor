topic, posthw1,"Question: Hi all,
We have made a minor correction to the grades from HW1. This correction could only potentially improve student grades by a few points. No one's grade went down.
In particular, under the ""Data Structures"" section of the ""Style, Organization, and Documentation"" portion of your grade, we have opted to give everyone the full five points. We decided to do so because the rubric was not consistent with the presentation of ADTs and data structures made in lecture.
If you had already received the full five points, then your grade remains unchanged. If you received fewer than five points, than your grade will have gone up a small amount.
Cheers,
Milod"

hw1,"Question: Hi! I wanted to make a regrade request on one section of my HW1 assignment in Gradescope. However, I did not see the button to allow them. Are they allowed for this assignment?
Answer: Yes, we do regrade requests, but they are done in-person at OH. There's also a two-week window from when the assignment grades are released to start a regrade request."
hw1,"Question: I have a feeling that the hidden tests that failed both on my hw1 final and hw2 current submission are the same. Will we get our hw1 grades before hw2 is due to see what mistakes we might have made in both programs?
Thanks!
Answer: Yes, you’ll get HW1 grades back before HW2 is due."
hw1,"Question: when I run my unit tests, it usually stops at 3/4 tests or even 0/1 tests. Is this a problem with my memory being too full, which I remember happened in cs11 as well? How can I approach this if my program's been buffering for a while.
Answer: I think that Elias' answer is likely correct. Typically if you are out of space, unit_test will fail to run altogether. But in your case, it seems like there is one test that it is unable to run to completion. It is highly likely that this test has some kind of infinite loop. unit_test times out automatically after 60 seconds—if you try to let it run for greater than this time, does it timeout?
If you'd like to free up space on your drive, you can run the ""free_space"" program, which will delete cached memory, or you can backup and remove old files, e.g., from CS 11. But I suspect your issue is not a quota issue."
hw1,"Question: Hi,
In part D of the read me where it states: 
""The files that you provided and a short description of what each file is and its purpose""
Is this asking for all the files we are submitting, including timer_main.cpp, simple_exception.cpp, and Makefile? Or just the files we directly affected, like CharArrayList.cpp, CharArrayList.h, and unit_test.h?
Thanks!
Answer: You should list and describe any file you submit and only submit the files your program depends on. So, you don't need to submit timer_main.cpp or simple_exception.cpp"
hw1,"Question: I got 72/72 but 71 should be the maximum. Does it mean there are hidden hidden tests?
Answer: Sorry, that's a mistake. 72 is the maximum score, not 71. I just updated gradescope. Thanks for catching that!"
hw1,"Question: I am confused about what to say for the README section asking us to explain how to compile and run our program. I only used unit_test and never made an executable to run. What should we say for this portion of the readme?
Answer: For this first homework, just saying that unit_test is used to compile and run is sufficient. We didn't expect you to edit the Makefile to produce an executable or anything for homework 1, but we will for future assignments (which is where that section is more pertinent)."
hw1,"Question: For the insertInOrder function in the spec, it says to assume that the array list is already in order. Does this mean that we should test whether or not the char we are inserting is greater/less than the characters in the array list from left to right? 
For example, if the current array list is ""ABEC"", and we want to call the insertInOrder function with 'D' as the argument, should the function set the array list to be ""ABDEC"" even though this is not in ASCII order? (not sure if I really worded this to make sense but was a bit confused by the spec's explanation of the function)
Answer: Ditto everything Thomas said. ABEC would not be a valid array to call insertInOrder on because clearly it is not properly sorted."
hw1,"Question: If the autograder gives a score like XX.5/72, how should that be interpreted? I pass all the unhidden tests, but would a half-point be given if a test has the correct result, but fails Valgrind? Or are some tests worth only half a point?
Answer: It could be any manner of things, whether that be a valgrind, style, or test issue somewhere in the program. You'll receive the whole report once grades are released."
hw1,"Question: The hw1 spec doesn't mention anything about the elementAt function handling empty arrays, should we treat it like the first function, and have it throw a runtime error? 
For example, if someone asks for elementAt(0) of an empty array, how should we handle that?"
hw1,"Question: Do I throw exceptions in both my CharArrayList.cpp file and my unit test file, so that then the unit test would be checking to see that both did/didn't throw exceptions and thus that they match? Or do I use cerr statements in my .cpp file that would then cause exceptions to be thrown in my unit test?
Or do I write hyperspecific ranges for each test I'm doing in another function and then try to throw the exception there? I feel like the simple_exception.cpp does this but the insertAt unit tests we are given don't. 
Answer: Elias's answer sums it up pretty well. Take a look at simple_exception.cpp (part of the starter files) for examples of how to throw exceptions."
hw1,"Question: How should we handle a case with an empty array list when replacing. Since 0 would technically still be in range of the index should be be able to replace?
Answer: When the spec says the range is [0 ... SIZE), [ is an inclusive boundary and ) is an exclusive boundary. You should not be able to replace at an index equal to the size.

(EDIT: replace, not insert)"
hw1,"Question: What is the syntax for formatting a dynamic exception error message, like the one in elementAt? I can't figure out how to integrate the variables into the message.
Answer: In order to throw an error message that contains variables, you can just use standard string concatenation. A runtime_error or range_error must take in a single string. So you'll need to concatenate the message format with any variables in their string format."
hw1,"Question: I made all 5 submissions and passed all of the non-hidden tests, but seemed to have failed one or two. Will we see all of them when we get our full score back?
Answer: Yes, you’ll see all of the hidden tests after we publish grades."
hw1,Question: Are we not allowed to use break or || symbols as part of the style guide? what are we supposed to use as a replacement?
hw1,"Question: The spec specifies that when we call insertAt, all of the elements to the right of the indicated index should shift one spot to the right. Should removeAt do the opposite? Meaning, should all of the elements to the right of the removed char shift back one spot to the left to fill the ""hole"" that the removed char leaves? My question also applies to popFromFront. Thanks!
Answer: I think the spec intro answers your question for you:
""Note that an array list cannot have “holes”: if you remove the fifth element (element 4) from a 10-element array list, then there are 9 elements left, and their positions are 0 through 8."""
hw1,"Question: When I try to run the timer executable, I get this error:
malloc(): corrupted top size
Abort (core dumped)
Any idea how to fix this? Is this an error with my code? Thanks!
Answer: Can you provide some more info? What exact command are you running? Have you been consistently running and passing your unit tests?"
hw1,"Question: Is it ok to include the following in my CharArrayList.cpp file?:
#include ""CharArrayList.h""
#include <stdexcept>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

When I don't include iostream I get errors such as these when running unit_test: no member named 'cout' in namespace 'std', even if I put std::cout or just cout. 

Do I need to have #include <sstream> like lab1 as well?
Answer: Yup, that is all definitely fine. sstream may not be strictly necessary, but you are welcome to use it if it is helpful for your implementation."
hw1,"Question: What is the policy on header files? E.g. which ones are we allowed to use and which ones should we refrain from using? Specifically, I want to use #include <sstream>, can I?
Answer: sstream is definitely okay! We don't have a standardized list of libraries that you're not allowed to use, as it changes from assignment assignment (e.g., for HW1 you are not allowed to use the vector library, but you are encouraged to use it for future assignments). In general, if you are not sure, you can ask on piazza and we'll let you know."
hw1,Question: Does the README need to follow the 80-column requirement of the style guide?
hw1,"Question: Hello. Should we write unit tests for the constructors and destructor?
Answer: Sure. That sounds like a good idea. Of note, there’s not much you can really test with the various constructors, other than that you don’t have a Valgrind issue with them. The destructor will always be implicitly called, but there’s not really a way to call it explicitly."
hw1,"Question: Just want to make sure if we are excepted to write function contracts for Constructors, Destructors, and Operator Overload (=) -- if we consider them functions at all?
Answer: The constructor, destructor, etc., are special member functions. So, yes, they do need function contracts."
hw1,"Question: Hello,
Section (F) of the README requirements in the homework spec, which asks for an outline of the data structures and algorithms you used, says to ""Please pick a couple interesting/complex algorithms to discuss in the README"".
What is this question looking for? In the context of CharArrayList, what would be interesting/complex algorithms? What should this discussion entail?
Answer: An algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task or solve a problem. For example, in lecture you all saw the steps or algorithm for expanding an array: Allocate a new, larger array, copy the elements over, and recycle the old array. It's high-level (minimal implementation details), but it describes how you solved a problem. 
You can describe a few algorithms that you implemented for this homework. Most of them are straightforward, but they will get more involved in later assignments."
hw1,"Question: Are we just copying the ReadMe from Lab01, making a new ReadMe in the HW1 folder, and filling it out for HW1?
Answer: You can definitely use the README from lab01 as a starting off point, just make sure that you answer and fill out all of the sections that the hw01 spec asks you to!"
hw1,"Question: Hello. I'm wondering if I can get more clarification on insertInOrder method.
The spec says we should insert the char in ASCII order. But I'm not sure what suffices this order. In the example given, 'C' - 'B' is 1. Should we only consider insertion when the character to be inserted is precisely 1 more than the previous element, or should we insert the character as long as it's numerically greater than the character before it, and smaller than the character after? 
Thank you."
hw1,"Question: Hi, for each function implementation in the cpp file, do we need to consider the condition if the list is empty? For instance, in first(), we can't return any value if the list is empty."
hw1,"Question: Hello!

In cs11, we had to enter ""use comp11"" every time we restarted terminal. 

In cs15, we entered ""echo ""use -q comp15\n"" >> ∼/.cshrc"" during Lab 1. Will this automatically enter ""use -q comp15"" for every assigment, not just Lab 1?

Thanks!"
hw1,"Question: Hello!
  Could you please help me understand how the what() function knows what message to print?
  In third_attempt_access, we are calling catch() from &e, but it looks like we never created the e object. I read a geeksforgeeks article about exceptions, and they created a special struct for their exception. I am guessing that our exception is created when we use throw(), but would appreciate confirmation/disproval.
  Thank you!
Answer: In the following code:
try {
   int result = attempt_access(arr, size, index);
   cout << ""Successfully accessed element!"" << endl;
   return result;
}
catch (const range_error &e) {
   cout << ""We just got the following error message:\n"";
   cout << e.what();
   return 0;
}
The line ""catch (const range_error &e)"" is what actually initializes and binds the variable e. Exceptions are actually just objects in C++, and as a result of that line, e is bound to the range_error object that is thrown as a result of the faulty access. We can then call the ""what()"" method on e, which returns the error message that is associated with that exception.
Hopefully that makes sense, but please let us know if you still have questions!"
hw1,"Question: I'm trying to test my first() function, and want to check that the runtime_error is thrown with an empty array list. how can i do this?"
hw1,"Question: For methods such as elementAt or removeAt (that require the dynamic error message), should they still have the bracket and parentheses combination for the interval [0, 0)? Or should this case be handled [0, 0]? Thanks
Answer: When in doubt, follow the spec. For an ArrayList of size zero, [0,0) would be correct because we can't remove from or index an empty list, so the empty range [0,0) is accurate."
hw1,"Question: In the hw1 spec, can i use the std::stringstream to implement to string? The same way that was done in the lab1.
Answer: Yep! Making this public for others."
hw1,"Question: The style guide specifies that they want us to use the keywords not/and/or instead of their special characters, however whenever I try to use these keywords VScode has an error saying that ""and is unidentified"" and sometimes that the program was expecting a ), however adding parenthesis' does not fix the error. The code does work if I use the && or || and ! symbols, it only has an error when I try to use the keywords, so I was wondering if I have to include a specific library to be able to use these keywords?
Answer: Nope, there aren't any libraries you need to include. As long as your code compiles on Halligan, you can ignore any ""errors"" VSCode gives (I ignore the subjective ones all the time). If you want, you can also turn them off in settings, or there might be something online about how to make it recognize not/and/or. Either way, you should still use not/and/or to comply with our style guide.
Edit: in general, VSCode will often yell at you and red-underline things that will compile just fine. My approach is to take VSCode’s error detection as a sign that something might be wrong, but I would always recommend trying to compile to find out definitively."
hw1,"Question: I fail Valgrind when I try to create a CharArrayList using that constructor but with an array of a size smaller than the int size I provided. Should we throw an error for this, or ensure that the size provided and the array size are the same?
Thanks!
Answer: The spec doesn't say what to do in that case, so your program can handle it however you like. For the array constructor, we won't test you on invalid inputs for the array (e.g., its size does not equal the size passed in, etc.) or the size (e.g., negative values, etc.)."
hw1,"Question: For this assignment, are characters always Aa-Zz or should we account for the possibility of a character being a number?
Answer: Numbers, e.g. '1', are valid characters as well!"
hw1,"Question: Given expand() is a private function in our .h file, how should we test its functionality? I am going to use expand in other functions, so should I test it within those, and assume that if those functions work, expand() must work?
Answer: You are allowed to make functions temporarily public in order to test them. Just remember to make it private again before submitting, and document that this is the approach you took. Also remember to comment out the unit test, as any failing tests should be commented out before submitting and it wouldn’t work with the function private."
hw1,"Question: Hello,
The interface functions in the homework spec with a string return type use std::string, like this:
std::string toString() const
Does this imply that we should not write using namespace std; in our header files (like I did in CS 11?)
Answer: It's generally good practice to avoid using a namespace in a header file. That's because a header file is intended to be ""include""-d in other client code files, and those clients shouldn't be forced to use a namespace, as this could cause things like name clashes. For a silly example, if a client has a variable named ""cout"", this would clash with std's cout. So generally, we leave namespaces out of headers, so that clients aren't forced to use them.
That said, it's fine to use namespaces in implementation files (i.e., .cpp files), as these are not typically included elsewhere."
hw1,"Question: Do we need to include function contracts in unit_test.h as well, or should they only be written in CharArrayList.cpp?
Answer: We do not require formal function contracts (name, purpose, arguments, etc.) in your unit testing file, but each test should have its own description of what it is testing."
hw1,"Question: The spec notes that we are allowed to use C++ strings when throwing exceptions, but does that mean we can use external methods such as std::to_string to concatenate a string made up of words and dynamic values, such as the message needed for the range error exception? Is there a simpler way to do this?
Answer: Yes, you can use to_string(). Making this public for others to see too."
hw1,"Question: Hi,
I entered /comp/15/files/hw_arraylists into my terminal to copy the starter files and got a message saying 'Permission denied'. Am I doing something wrong?
Thank you!
Answer: The file permissions issues have been resolved. When you type the command /comp/15/files/hw_arraylists, your session interprets the hw_arraylists directory as a command, and tries to execute it. When it realizes it’s a directory, it gets mad at you.
The correct command is cp /comp/15/files/hw_arraylists/* .
There are a couple things to note here. First, the cp command takes the following form: cp [source] [destination], where source is a file and destination is a directory. The period at the end is very important, as it is the destination for the file. The period is short hand for “this directory”. The asterisk in cp /comp/15/files/hw_arraylists/* . refers to every file in the hw_arraylists directory. So, in total, /comp/15/files/hw_arraylists/* . tells your terminal to copy every file from /comp/15/files/hw_arraylists/ and move it into the current directory.
If you try all of this and still have issues, reply to this post and we can go from there."
hw2,"Question: Hi all,
HW1 has been released! You can find it on the course schedule. It’s due one week from today, Tuesday Jan. 28th 11:59pm. Some tips that will be useful for this and every HW:
Start early. These assignments are far easier if you do a little bit every day. 
Plan before you code. Before you write the code for an array list function, you should have a thorough understanding of exactly how that function will work. Drawing diagrams always helps! You should also make sure to consider edge cases: inserting into or removing from an empty list, inserting at the first or last position of a list, etc.
Test, test, and test some more. As soon as you write a new function, it’s a good idea to write at least one test for that function. Try to test every possible path through a function, e.g., if a function uses an `if` statement, you want to write tests that hit every possible branch of that statement. Finally, make sure to test edge cases as well. We will look at your tests! Part of your grade is based on how thoroughly you tested your program. We've given you some (initially commented out) tests in your starter code to provide an example of what a good test set looks like.
Additionally, if you haven't already, you need to familiarize yourself with our grading procedures as outlined on the course policy page. A few minutes after you submit, you will be able to view your autograder score on Gradescope, as well as a description of a subset of our autograder tests. This can help you catch latent errors in your program. Remember: You are only allowed 5 submissions. So, use those submissions wisely. This means you need to thoroughly test your own code—you can't rely on the autograder for debugging. 
Finally, keep in mind that your autograder score is just one portion of your total assignment grade. We will also grade you based on:
Functionality and design
Testing (remember to submit your tests!!)
Structure, Organization, and Documentation (read our course style guide)
Best of luck! The TAs and I will be here to help you.
Cheers,
Milod"
hw2,"Question: Are we allowed to use the sstream library for hw2?
Answer: Yes"
hw2,"Question: Hi,
I'm a little confused on what Q3 of the README is asking. Are we assuming the client knows what goes under the hood behind all the functions? 
Answer: A client will never know what goes on under the hood, that's the purpose of abstraction. Q3 is saying to suppose a client is using CharArrayList, what changes would they need to make to instead use CharLinkedList? For example, unit_test was a client of CharArrayList in HW1. Think about the changes you had to make to your HW1 tests to transform them into a client of CharLinkedList for HW2.
I hope that example puts the question into more concrete terms, but follow up if you'd like more clarification!"
hw2,"Question: I have a function that is at 30 lines and I don't want to go over 30 lines since that is the limit in the style guide. I want to add comments to make the code easier to understand. Would these comments count towards the amount of lines my function has, making my function not valid with the style guide?
Answer: Your functions should not go over 30 lines, except for special cases of a command loop, which won’t be applicable until the 2nd project. If your function is nearing 30 lines, there should be sirens going off that you can make it more modular. If you would be way under without any comments, then that likely means you are commenting way too much. Remember, we want inline comments for special cases, bugs, and hard to read parts. Strive to make the code as readable as possible by reducing nesting, using modular functions, and naming descriptively.
If you want, you can post your specific code and we can see what advice we can give you."
hw2,"Question: If I submit 2 submissions into gradescope, the autograder runs, and I don't like the results, but I will need more time to find out what went wrong, would I still be able to submit the next day with a late token, use another one of my 3 autograder tests? Or would the submission be locked after my first submission?

Thank you!
Answer: Yes, you can submit again using a token, even if you have already submitted before the deadline. Just be aware that you have 5 submissions total, no matter what—using tokens does not buy you extra submissions."
hw2,"Question: Hello! I am passing all of my unit tests. However, I got 15 points off on the autograder. I was wondering if you could give me any tips on where to start looking. Thank you!
Answer: Hi - there could be many places where points are being lost. First take a look at the autograder score - are you passing all the available tests, and the style check? If you are passing all, then you are likely failing some hidden tests. I would then check the spec. We are highly specific with things like our error messages, so double check not only that you are throwing the right messages and constructing the right strings, but also that you are asserting them correctly. The spec will also mention specific cases that we will test, like self-concatenation.
If all that fails, you likely need more unit tests. Make sure you are testing all functions for all cases (including throwing errors). We highly recommend you follow the form for the insertAt tests provided for you.
I am making this public in case other students have similar questions/issues. If you have particular questions about code, please make a private post."
hw2,"Question: Do our functions have to abide by the interface given in the specs verbatim? For example, can we change

void concatenate(CharLinkedList *other);

to 

void concatenate(const CharLinkedList *other); ?
This might help when I wish to call concatenate(other) in certain cases where the ""other"" CLL is const at the instance.
Answer: No, you may not change the interface. The above declarations create two different functions. So, the autograder tests won't compile with your code if it makes a call to concatenate(CharLinkedList *other), passing in a non-const CharLinkedList because your CharLinkedList interface won't have a concatenate function that takes in this type."
hw2,"Question: Should the last element point back to the first element as the ""next"" node in a circular fashion, or is that up to us?
Answer: Up to you, I suppose. As long as you have a doubly linked list that subscribes to the specifications in the spec, then you should be good. It might be harder to implement CharLinkedList as circular, but feel free to go for it if you feel comfortable doing so."
hw2,"Question: When I run the destructor on my list of 
1000000 elements then I get a stack overflow. Is this something to be expected or is there something I need to fix?
Answer: If this is only happening for larger lists, it is quite likely that your program is just running out of memory. Assuming you implemented your destructor using a recursive helper function, keep in mind that for each call to the helper function, some new stack space is allocated. A very large number of calls could mean you use up all of the space that is available to your program.
Make sure to thoroughly test your destructor on smaller lists, keeping an eye out for memory issues via valgrind (which is run automatically by unit_test). If everything works fine for smaller list sizes, then you are probably good to go."
hw2,"Question: Hello! 
I was running my unit tests and somewhere in between, I got this error about disk quota being exceeded. I know this happened to some people in CS11 and they solved it by deleting big output files, but we don't have output files in CS15, only header and cpp so far.  Please how do I handle it? 
Thank you! 
Answer: The student answer is good advice; start there. If that doesn’t work, I’d recommend going through your other files (like those in your cs11 folder, if it exists), and delete all the testing files/.o files."
hw2,"Question: Do we only need to implement the errors provided in the function description? Take this function for example:
  Can I throw an error of ""remove from empty LinkedList"" or can my program ONLY error with ""index (IDX) not in range [0..SIZE)""? Would there be some edge cases testing removeAt(0) etc...
I would assume that I should only throw the error provided and no other ""edge cases""? Otherwise in what order would I throw my errors (like would it first check if the list is empty or first check the index out of range)?
Answer: The student's answer is correct. Also, throwing errors not specified in the spec would cause your program to end early or print a different error message, and the autograder would fail that test. Please only throw errors mentioned in the spec"
hw2,"Question: I have a few methods that go over 30 lines, mostly due to many Node element reassignments, ex:

Struct *ptr2 = new Struct();
ptr1->elem1 = data;  
ptr1->elem2 = ptr2->elem2;  
ptr1->elem3 = ptr2;

Would it be stylistically appropriate to put similar assignments on the same line separated by commas, ex:

ptr1->elem1 = data, ptr1->elem2 = ptr2->elem2, ptr1->elem3 = ptr2;
run code snippetVisit Manage Class to disable runnable code snippets×
to decrease the number of lines in a method?

Thanks!
Answer: Although the style guide doesn't mention anything about this, I would recommend not using multiple variable declarations in the same statement because it isn't as readable as declaring variables across multiple lines. But, with your example above, you could probably make a helper function that would condense all five lines into only one or two."
hw2,"Question: Do we need to organize our unit_test header file in terms of readability (i.e. grouped by method)? On the previous homework, I grouped all of my tests based on the method they corresponded to, which matched the order in the class header file. However, it feels a lot more intuitive to have the tests in the order that I wrote them because they build upon each other. Does this matter? (Given that the necessary commenting is included and the test names are descriptive.)
Thank you!
Answer: The style guide doesn't mention anything about this, so how you organize unit_test.h is up to you. As you said, as long as each test has a descriptive name and brief description, you're all set."
hw2,"Question: For the elementAt and replaceAt function, the hw specs say that they ""must be use a private recursive helper function"". Does that mean that the only thing that can go inside the brackets of elementAt function (for example) is the recursive function? Or are we allowed to add more lines/functions beside the recursive function?"
hw2,"Question: Hello!

Because toString is const, compiler indicates an error when I am using a helper function that wasn’t declared as const. When I declare the helper function as const, compiler throws another error, because I am using this->size inside the helper function (and size() is not const).
  Could you please recommend a way to circumvent this? Would it be ok if I re-implement size() inside toStringHelper?

Thank you!

P.S.
The error message I mentioned:

hw2,"Question: Hello! 
When we get an empty list as an argument for our clear function, should we just leave the list untouched? Or is there an exception we should throw? I am asking because the spec does not specify. 
Thank you! "
hw2,"Question: Regarding using strings in implementation, the spec states this:
""You may not use any C++ strings in your CharLinkedList implementation, except for:
◦ In the toString() and toReverseString() functions.
◦ When throwing exception messages.""
Since we can/should use private helper functions for the recursive logic, could we use strings for any helper function(s) we use for either toString() or toReverseString()?
Answer: Yes, I would say that's fine? Another instructor can correct me if I'm wrong!"
hw2,"Question: Is it necessary to have a recursive function helper specifically for replaceAt?
I can implement replaceAt with two other public functions and inside those functions are recursivehelpers. 
I'm asking this just to be clearer:

hw2,"Question: In my CharLinkedList.h file, the line defining my newNode method exceeds 80 characters because it must include Class::Struct along with the next and previous node parameters. This issue only occurs in my .h file, not in my .cpp file, since the line in the .h file is indented with a tab (equivalent to four spaces) due to common convention, whereas .cpp files do not follow this convention.
Would it be acceptable to write *nxt and *prv or even *n and *p for the parameters, even though they are written as *next and *prev in my Node struct? If so, would it be fine to use the full *next and *prev in the .cpp file since they fit? Or should I take an entirely different approach?
Answer: If you have a class function that returns a class struct (e.g., Node), as long as it is private function (which it likely should be), you can simply have it return a type node.
In other words, assuming function some_func is valid, then you can have
private:
Node some_fun();,
and you won’t need
CharLinkedList::Node some_fun();
That being said, in your .h file (or .cpp file), if you have a function declaration that is going over 80 characters, you are encouraged to break up the list of parameters into several lines. I.e., you can do
void CharLinkedList::some_fun(int param1,
                              char param2,
                              bool param3)
instead of this:
void CharLinkedList::some_fun(int param1, char param2, bool param3)"
hw2,"Question: Hello! 
For the CharLinkedList constructor, are we allowed to assume that we will never get an empty array parsed? If not, how do we handle that? The spec does not specify if we should throw a runtime error or if we should just not create a list.

Answer: You code should be able to handle if an empty array is passed in. If someone tries to construct a linked list from an empty array, the result should be an empty linked list that holds no elements."
hw2,"Question: Hello,
Are we intended to use a ""back"" pointer (a pointer to the end of the linked list in addition to the front pointer) for HW2? The spec doesn't seem to specify.

project,"Question: Hi, i was wondering do we need to add functions into the header file for datum? Because for now it only has the less than checking function. About it was mentioned the greater than and other comparing functions on the spec.
Thank you!
Answer: With the equal function and the less than function, you should have all you need in order to generate the logic for the greater than function (and less than, and greater, etc) 

This is also mentioned in the spec:

The less-than (<) operator for Datum holding integers. Using the less-than operator and the is-equal-to operator, we can build less-than-or-equal (<=), greater-than-or-equal (>=), and greater-than (>). Use of any of these operators on Datum which hold booleans or rstrings will raise a std::runtime_error with the message “datum_not_int”."

Indentation for main should be just like any other file, which in this class is probably 4 spaces. You can check the set tab size for a given file in vscode by looking at the bottom right, there should be a ""Spaces: 4"". You can also turn on whitespace detection in settings so that there are dots where any spaces are and then just count."
project,"Question: I know they close automatically when they go out of scope, but the spec says, ""Always remember to deallocate all previously heap-allocated memory and close all previously opened files before your program terminates!""
This causes an issue when using a general istream for input. Since std::istream doesn't have a close() method like std::ifstream does, how should we handle this? Is it fine to not explicitly close our streams?
Answer: You should absolutely close any files that are opened. This includes any input files that are later used as an istream in the program. The reason you don't need to explicitly close the general istream is because if just cin were used, this wouldn't require explicit closing. Valgrind should point out any files or streams that might be left open after the program finishes."

If so, how would we do this, and how could we change the unit_test command to unit_test_passenger or unit_test_main?
Answer: Given that you don't have access to our unit_test_driver code, it's not possible to do explicitly what you're saying. You could alternatively just break up unit_tests.h using big block comments and have a section for passenger and a section for main. Or if you really want multiple different testing programs for the separate functionality, you could make your own test_passenger.cpp that has a main that runs a set of tests that you make. And then simply create a Makefile rule to turn this into an executable to run.
Keep in mind though that C++ doesn't allow more than 1 file with a main() to be compiled together, so you'll have to make sure that test_passenger.cpp doesn't ever get compiled or linked with your main.cpp. This isn't an issue as long as the files are kept independent of each other."

Project 1 has been released. You can find the spec in the usual spot on the course calendar. A few things about this project:
The final submission is due two weeks from today, but there are two deliverables due next week by 11:59pm on Wednesday, Feb. 12: (1) you must complete a design checkoff by presenting your design to a TA during office hours, and (2) you must submit the code and tests for two classes in your program. You can see the spec for more details on both of these deliverables. For (1), you need to sign up for a design checkoff slot during office hours. You can do so here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18VynOjTK1GSrMDCqvoNK35B2qJ4AO8h2ZQ_zNnF7ENY/edit?usp=sharing
It is necessary that you start this one early. This is a bigger assignment with several components, and we've given you relatively little starter code. It is very doable (and a fun one!) if you start early. It will not be doable if you wait until the last couple of days before the deadline.
We provide you with a reference implementation that you can run to see what the final product looks like. Use this implementation! Many questions that we get about this assignment can be answered by running the reference implementation. Moreover, once you have your own program up and running, you should compare the output of your program to the output of the reference by using the command line tool diff—see this helpful reference document on using diff. Testing your program with diff is crucial if you want to get a good autograder score. 
I'll say it once again: start this one early. The assignment may seem daunting at first, but it is very manageable if you break it down into components, and incrementally design and implement each component. Best of luck, and have fun with it!

exam,"Question: Hello everyone!
SIS seems to have changed the timing of its grade publishing. I had anticipated grades being published tomorrow, but they are apparently now out. Well then!
Final course and exam grades have now been posted posted. See below for a description of each.
Course Grades
You can find these on SIS. Overall, the class did very well: 62% of students got an A- or better. Nicely done!
Grades were tabulated using the formula on the course admin page. For projects with multiple phases, design checkoffs counted for 5%, phase 1 code submissions counted for 10%, and final submissions counted for the remainder of the project grade (either 85% or 90%, depending on whether there was a design checkoff). This semester, we also decided to drop the lowest HW score. If this was a regular HW, the lowest score was dropped entirely. If it was a project, the score counted half as much.
Additionally, everyone received a 0.5% boost on their overall grade. This means that if you were on the border of getting a higher grade, you got the higher grade. Please do not email to ask for a higher grade—you already got the boost, and if this did not improve your grade, then you were not that close to the next highest grade.
Final Exam Grades
You can find these under the assignment titled ""Final exam score"" on Gradescope. The class also did very well here: the median score was 89%, and the average was 86.1%.
In keeping with the tradition of paper finals, we will not be releasing the exams themselves. If you would like to see your final exam, I will hold virtual office hours this Monday and Tuesday from 1-2pm each day in my zoom room: https://tufts.zoom.us/my/milod

exam,"Question: The answer to @590 says that we aren't expected to have any specific code memorized for the exam. Would you say that algorithms we implemented in labs are fair game? Should we still be knowledgeable about the low-level implementation/pseudocode of algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Sorting, Heapify, or potentially AVL rotations, etc.) or is knowing how the algorithms are executed on a ""higher level"" sufficient (i.e. execute the algorithm step-by-step to complete the traversal/sort/invariant)?
More concretely, in the case of AVL rotations on the midterm, it seemed fair to be expected to draw the tree step-by-step at each insertion, but we didn't have to write any pseudocode for implementation. Is it realistic to assume the same will be true on the final with other algorithms?"
exam,"Question: Hello!

We discussed that for radix sort, we should perceive elements as if they had 0s in front. i.e., if the biggest element has 5 digits, then we would perceive 2 as 00002.

Review slides contain a problem about sorting the following words alphabetically [""izzy"", ""bob"", ""alice"", ""chad"", ""milod"", ""ivy""]
In this case, would it be correct to perceive all words as if they had Zs in front? For example, ""bob"" would be ""zzbob"".

Thank you!

EDIT: I realized I should have used MSD Radix Sort here, as strings have variable length.
Answer: In fact, you cannot use LSD radix sort to sort variable-length strings for this exact reason — there is no way to ""pad"" shorter strings without potentially altering alphabetical order of the elements. Only MSD radix sort can be used to sort variable length strings. This is something that is mentioned in the lecture slides as well. For MSD radix sort, you would not pad the strings, but rather simply treat the shorter string as alphabetically first."

exam,"Question: Hello!
When discussing ways to choose a pivot for Quick Sort, we mentioned picking a median of 3 elements. Could you please help me understand how Quick Sort would work if the median was not among the values?
The last step of Hoare Partitioning Procedure is to swap data[pivot] with data[left]. But what if there is no index that corresponds to the median of 3? Should we then choose an index corresponding to an element that is closest to the median of 3?
Thank you!
Answer: To clarify: I believe when picking the median of 3 elements was considered, the median being referred to was that of those specific 3 elements, not of the list as a whole.
A key idea with quicksort is how different choices for the pivot value yield different results. The worst pivot choice is the greatest or smallest element in the list, and after partitioning results in just one element being in the right place. This leads to an inefficient recursive step, makes quicksort essentially selectionSort, and makes quicksort worst-case O(n^2) time.
The last step of the Hoare partitioning algorithm is not always very intuitive. As you increment the left index and decrement the right index, the algorithm stops when the left equals the right. This means that the partition point has been found. The last step is just to place the element at the pivot index in its appropriate position, such that everything to the left of it is less than the pivot and everything to the right is greater than the pivot. If the pivot index is left of the partition (i.e., in the “less-than” side), then you’d want to swap the left index of the array, so that it can when it’s in its new position everything is still partitioned properly.
I think the indices and the swapping can often be confusing. For me, it helps to think that at the end we have to place the pivot element at the partition point, and given the partition element is often in the leftmost index, we want to take the rightmost element of the left partition and swap the two.
I hope this helps clear up some things. Please let me know if you have any questions."
exam,"Question: On the practice exam, there was a question about the time complexity of inserting into a bad hash table that used linked list chaining in each bucket. The answer key said that if the function takes all keys to the same bucket, then insertion is O(n). I don't see why there is any reason to take the item to the back, unless they are picturing keeping the elements sorted somehow. Why can't we just add to front of LL in O(1) and then deal with the consequences in access time later? Simply adding to the back seems like O(n) for no reason. Chaining doesn't imply sorted insertion, does it? Access would still not be constant even if sorted. Thanks
Answer: Yeah, this is a good question/catch. It really depends on what we mean by insertion. Very often (basically always in any real implementation), an ""insert"" operation also functions as an ""update"" operation — not only do we insert keys, but we actually check to see if they are there first and if so update the value associated with them. That way, if we later look up a key, there will only be a single value associated with it. Assuming ""insert"" also means ""update if it already exists"", then we have to search for our element in the linked list, hence the O(n) worst case.

That said, the practice question is ambiguous about this. We would make any such assumptions clear on the exam."
exam,"Question: Hi! I was wondering if we could get our mid term cheat sheet back and if so, where could we pick it up."
exam,"Question: Hello!

In the complexity analysis for Dijkstra's algorithm, we said that the code inside the yellow rectangle is O(|V|⋅log|V|).

When I was doing this analysis by hand, I thought that the ""u ← Q.extract_min()"" operation is not log|V| each time, but rather decreases at every step. So, I counted the complexity of the yellow portion as log(1) + log(2) + ... + log(|V|) = log(1⋅2⋅...⋅|V|) = log(|V|!).

Could you please let me know if the below statement is correct? 
""Both analyses are correct because both of them provide an upper bound. However, O(|V|⋅log|V|) provides a less tight bound, and O(log(|V|!)) provides a more tight bound.""
Thank you!


 
Answer: This is a great observation. Before I go on, I'll note: this is a much more in-depth complexity analysis than we would test you on for the final exam.
You're correct to come up with the O(log V!) complexity for the orange loop (and in fact, this same logic could be extended to other parts of Dijkstra's algorithm. The ""hand wavy"" analysis shown in the slides upper bounds this number by assuming there are V elements in the heap each time an element is extracted, but as you point out, there will actually be fewer elements with each iteration.
But, where things get interesting: it turns out that log(V!) can be very precisely approximated using a function proportional to V*log(V). This is called Stirling's approximation, and it will haunt you if you go on to take 160 or some other CS/math classes. What this means is that log(V!) is actually approximately O(V log V) anyway — so either way you go about the analysis, you reach the same conclusion. There is a helpful explanation of all of this here, if you scroll down to the section titled ""Further Runtime Considerations: Repeated Minheap Insertions (or Deletions)""."

Answer: I just posted them as a follow-up to @573"
exam,"Question: In the midterm, we should ""assume the standard interface.""
Are we expected to use the standard libraries accurately if we want to, say, use a priority queue in the coding section? Or is it okay to use informal but also clear ones like ""getmin""?
Answer: You're not expected to have entire library interfaces memorized, that would be crazy. As long as you use clear function names that exist for that library but perhaps under a different name, you'll be fine. For example, if some library has a function elementAt() but you call at(), it's all good! We just need to be able to understand what you're trying to do :)"
exam,"Question: We did not talk about heap sort during lectures. But I guess it's O(nlogn) for time and O(1) for space? Also, is it not stable, and why is it not (or actually stable)?
Answer: You will not be responsible for knowing anything about heap sort on the final exam as we did not talk about it in class.

That said, in essence, heap sort puts all elements in a heap, then removes them one at a time—the removed elements will be in sorted order. For n elements, that's n insertions which are each O(log n) in the worst case, hence it is a O(n log n) algorithm.
Heap sort is typical done in place. In essence, the array used to represent the heap can also be used to eventually store the sorted elements. As each element is removed from the heap, a spot in the array opens up, where we place the newest element extracted from the heap.
Finally, heap sort is typically not stable, because inserting then removing elements from a heap does not maintain the original order in which elements were inserted."
exam,"Question: Hello!
In the Graph Traversals lecture, we discussed that the total complexity of BFS when used with adjacency lists is O(|V| + |E|). 

When I was performing this complexity analysis on my own, I computed that the worst-case complexity is O(|V|^2). (This happens when every node is connected to every other node.)

My question is: would both answers be perceived as correct on the exam? Is it ok to leave the answer in terms of |E|, even when we know that in the worst case |E| is |V|^2.

I would appreciate if you help unconfuse me, because I thought that we use big O to represent only worst-case complexity.
Thank you!
Answer: You are correct that big O is used to provide upper bounds on complexities. You are also correct that in the worst case every vertex is connected to every other vertex resulting in O(V^2) edges, and thereby giving BFS a time complexity of O(V^2).
However, when it comes to graph operations, we typically express complexities in terms of both V and E. This gives us a more precise expression, which can be useful in analyzing an algorithm. Many graphs are sparse, meaning they will have far fewer than O(V^2) edges. Knowing that an algorithm is O(V+E) therefore gives us a better sense of how the algorithm operates on different graphs with more or fewer edges.
I'll also add: while big O does provide an upper bound on complexities, it is generally more useful to provide the tightest upper bound. Technically, BFS is also O(2^V), i.e., it can be upper bounded by an exponential function. But it's much more useful/informative to know a tighter upper bound. For the same reason, O(V+E) is a more informative upper bound than O(V^2)."

exam,"Question: Hello!

Slides from lab 7 say that the following is a weird case. Could someone please help me understand why is it weird? Doesn't it exactly follow the general solution?

Thank you!
Answer: Maybe ""weird"" wasn't the right word to use, but what I meant was that this case it's a bit more difficult to understand conceptually because the original right and left rotations shown in the beginning of the slides aren't representative of what to do in this case, where there is a subtree that is affected by its parent becoming the root and the previous root becoming one of the new root's children."

exam,"Question: something i dont understand is quite how heights work for AVL trees. I understand that you calculate the heights of nodes by traversing from a given node to the farthest leaf node, but what if the given leaf node is still at a higher level? is it not a leaf because its not at the lowest level, therefore making its height not 0?
Answer: To add on to the previous answer, the height of a node is not based on distance from the root. Two nodes can have the same depth but different heights, and different leaves can be at different depths of the same tree."

exam,"Question: Hello!

When talking about complexity, we discussed that we can ignore the ""expand and copy"" operation when counting complexity. Because of that, we said that complexity of inserting at back of ArrayList is O(1) instead of O(n)

For the exam, should we also ignore the ""expand and copy"" operation? 

Thank you!
Answer: While I am not able to comment on the specifics of the midterm having not seen the exam, I will try to explain this so that you'll be able to answer any questions about it in the test.

We generally say that we can ignore the ""expand and copy"" operations when pushing an element to the back of an array list because this only happens in the worst case. The exact reasoning behind that is beyond the scope of this course, but the idea is that the copying over is only done infrequently so the typical insertion is only $O(1)$. It is of course possible for an insertion to take $O(n)$ time in the worst case scenario, but we usually say that the cost of inserting at the back of an array list is $O(1)$.

I would say as a general rule of thumb to think about inserting to the back of an array list as $O(1)$, but you should understand that there can be specific insertions that cost more. Other TAs, feel free to expand on this if I am missing anything."

exam,"Question: Hello! 

Could someone please confirm/disprove that in LL we change heights as follows:
- height of k1 remains unchanged
- height of k2 is decreased by 2

I am attaching a drawing that led me to this conclusion.

Thank you!
Answer: Your reasoning looks sound to me! But I will provide one clarification and one caveat:
The clarification: the height of k1 remains unchanged and the height of k2 decreases by 2 relative to before the rotation, but not relative to before the insertion. The tree on the left is the state of the tree after the new node was inserted. So, your assertions about k1 and k2's heights would be different if we were talking about the heights relative to before the insertion.
The caveat: Your reasoning is true when we perform a single right rotation in the LL case. But, there are other times when we perform a right rotation; for example, if k is a node that is out of balance due to the RL case, then we would first perform a single right rotation at k->right. In such a case, your reasoning no longer holds, because k->right was not actually out of balance, we are just performing the rotation as one part of a double rotation. So, if you were writing a ""rightRotate"" function which could be called for either a single rotation or as part of a double rotation (as is the case in the AVL lab), you would not want to hard code the heights following the rules you have provided above, because the rules do not apply in the double rotation case."
exam,"Question: In lecture, we said that ASCII encodes 128 characters using 7 bits/character, but that modern ASCII is 8 bits/character. Hypothetically, if we got asked to compare ASCII encoding to Huffman encoding on the exam, would we use the old 7-bit ASCII version or modern 8-bit version?

logistics,"Question: We did not talk about heap sort during lectures. But I guess it's O(nlogn) for time and O(1) for space? Also, is it not stable, and why is it not (or actually stable)?
Answer: You will not be responsible for knowing anything about heap sort on the final exam as we did not talk about it in class.

That said, in essence, heap sort puts all elements in a heap, then removes them one at a time—the removed elements will be in sorted order. For n elements, that's n insertions which are each O(log n) in the worst case, hence it is a O(n log n) algorithm.
Heap sort is typical done in place. In essence, the array used to represent the heap can also be used to eventually store the sorted elements. As each element is removed from the heap, a spot in the array opens up, where we place the newest element extracted from the heap.
Finally, heap sort is typically not stable, because inserting then removing elements from a heap does not maintain the original order in which elements were inserted."

However, we wanted to check first if excluding it is allowed, and if we do need an open or die function, what sort of error should be thrown.
Answer: You never need an open or die function, but if you want to know how the provided code handles file read errors, you should try experimenting with it! You can use chmod to set read write and execute permissions on a file. For example, if you make a new file and then run the command: chmod 000 FILENAME it will remove all permissions, so that file will always fail to open for reading and writing. Then you can see if the code catches that successfully or not."

logistics,"Question: IMPORTANT: Please make sure only one person submits Gerp each time and then adds their partner to it!

As you all get ready to start Gerp, we wanted to share with you a guide on pair programming. Pair programming is a highly valuable skill that pops up in later CS courses here at Tufts as well as in many programming jobs (even interviews). That said, it doesn’t often get taught explicitly, so we want to share this guide with you. It details some best practices and styles, as well as some anti-patterns (things that seem like they would be helpful but aren’t) to watch out for as you work.

Tuple's Pair Programming

Tools and tricks
VS Code LiveShare. This is a great tool for pair programming, whether you partner virtually or not. Many pairing guides advise having one keyboard per person (everyone’s more comfortable on their own, even if you both use the same model). This allows for that and takes it a step further: you can each view the code with your own preferred themes and fonts.
One caveat: with liveshare, it’s very easy to fall out of pair programming and into a divide & conquer workflow. 
Divide & Conquer programming is not pair programming. A good litmus test is, if both partners are typing at the same time and code is being produced, they are dividing & conquering instead of pairing.

LiveShare has features that can help with this called focus and follow. These allow a navigator to “pin” their screen to whatever the current driver is editing. We highly recommend using these features most of the time as you start pairing.

Best of luck!

logistics,"Question: Hi all, below are instructions on how to diff test with unit_tests:
Fun fact—you can diff using unit_tests! This might be pretty helpful for testing classes within the current assignment proj_metrosim. This is a completely optional process, and you only need to do it if you deem it necessary while testing.
Background
You can diff between two output streams, stdout and stderr, i.e. statements printed from cout and statements printed from cerr.
The splitting of output streams and individually diff-ing them is similar to the below series of commands, as seen in lab 3, but just in a unit_test. Instead of a reference implementation, however, there will be a text file. The unit_test will diff the text file and output stream of the test.
./evil gradebook.txt > my.stdout 2> my.stderr
./evil_reference gradebook.txt > ref.stdout 2> ref.stderr
diff my.stdout ref.stdout
diff my.stderr ref.stderr
run code snippetVisit Manage Class to disable runnable code snippets×
Setup
To make the reference files that the unit_test will diff off of, one needs to make a directory for each output stream in the same directory that unit_tests.h is in, i.e. mkdir stdout and mkdir stderr.
When you run unit_test, the framework will search for these folders, and diff based on the files in those directories.
After making the directories for each output stream, create a file that has the same name as the unit_test you want to make reference input for, e.g. if a test is named void foo_constructor(), then the file should be foo_constructor. You can do this with either a text editor on Halligan like nano or sync Remote->Local, and edit on VS Code. Note: Make sure the file is in the right folder, i.e. if you want to diff stdout, place it in the stdout directory.
Finally, run unit_test, like normal, and inspect the
test report for a column that says diff passed? for the result!"
logistics,"Question: Is it ever possible to read files in unit_test just like what we do in main?
Answer: You can definitely read in a hardcoded file in unit_test! You won't be able to give the file as a command line argument like you would when running a program that you made, but you can still do all of the other code that you might in main and just use some hardcoded file as opposed to arg[_]"

Answer: Tokens only allow you to extend the due date, not the number of submissions. If you use one token or two, you will always only have five total submissions.
So, yes, if you submit today, you can use your remaining submissions without losing another token."

other,"Question: Hi everyone! Welcome to CS15!

This post will be long, but it outlines some important information you’ll find helpful throughout the semester, so please read it all!
------------------------------------------------
PIAZZA AND OFFICE HOURS CHECKLIST
------------------------------------------------
Office hours will begin on Wednesday, January 22nd. Our policies may differ slightly from what you’re used to, so please read them carefully. These policies apply to both Office Hours and Piazza.
Before asking a TA for help, please try the following techniques:
Add output statements to narrow down the source of the bug to one line or function
Run valgrind
Perform thorough unit tests
Check that the issue cannot be found on Piazza, stack overflow, or the course resources page
Read the spec, the provided documentation, and the style guide
If you would still like to speak to a TA after trying the above things, please add yourself to the queue with a detailed description of your issue on the whiteboard or your Piazza post. This approach helps the TAs understand your and other students’ issues.
We reserve the right to place students back on the queue without answering their questions if there is no evidence that the student has not taken the above steps. This policy may seem tedious, but doing so will allow you to get help more quickly and improve your skills as a programmer!

Please note: When writing a Piazza post, it is okay, and you are even encouraged to keep posts public so others can learn from the discussion, but any sensitive information, solutions, or code MUST be posted privately to the instructors.
-------------------------------------------
HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS ON PIAZZA
-------------------------------------------
tl;dr: explain your problems and your process fully. Don’t post questions like “xxxx is not working,” “xxxx issues,” or “weird bug with xxxx.”
Asking questions is a part of learning. Understanding how to ask questions is a powerful skill that will serve you well in this class and beyond.
People like answering well-asked questions; please ask them! Here is how:
1. Spend time debugging on your own
It’s really easy to jump to asking mode when encountering an issue you’ve never seen before. That’s good! It will help you learn. Before you make a post or rush to office hours, however, start by asking questions to yourself:
What can I do to resolve this issue on my own?
How is this similar to things I’ve seen before?
What do my resources (course material, valgrind, google, other questions posted on Piazza, your classmates, your gerp partner!!) tell me about this issue?
If a question is easily Google-able, you can answer it faster on your own than through a piazza question. Please try to google your issues.
This process will help you understand the issue better, which will help you resolve it or at least help you ask about it.
2. Include a descriptive title and body
When you do post on Piazza, be as descriptive as possible. We don’t have access to your code and may not have all the context of the issue that you are having. Posting generic questions (like the examples above) for specific issues makes things difficult for two reasons:
Other people with the same issue will have no idea your post will help them, defeating the purpose of help forums.
It leaves others to find your errors for you instead of guiding you on how to fix them.
Asking specific, well-worded questions is a great way to get help quickly.
Let’s say I have an issue where my input file isn’t being read correctly, so I make a post called “help with setup problem.” Why has no one responded to my question? Because hundreds of setup issues are posted on Piazza every semester. If I had instead posted something more like “vscode terminal frozen on login with error message: ‘Failed to connect to terminal: shell type not supported,’” students and instructors who have seen the error before can reply quickly with the solution.

Equally important is the body of the post. While the title is important, describing the entire issue is the correct way to get a good answer. When you’re writing your post, please explain the following things at least:
What are you trying to do? Are you compiling, testing, running? Tell us what was happening when you encountered the problem. Give input and output if it applies as well.
What specifically is causing the problem? Don’t post a screenshot of your entire .cpp file(s); instead, try to narrow down the source as much as possible. Looking at an issue within a few lines of code or a function is much easier for everyone involved than looking at an entire program.
What have you done to fix the issue? What did you learn from commenting out code, adding output statements, and running valgrind? Please explain this process and what you know about the bug! This context helps us think of things you might not have tried yet and gives us more information about your bug.
Bonus: How is this similar or different to issues you’ve seen before (in your own experience and right here on Piazza)?
There is an excellent resource on Stack Overflow (“the Ocean version of the Piazza Pond”) that explains all these points, and I highly encourage you to read it if you get a chance. Link here: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask

Piazza is an amazing resource. Asking questions is GOOD. Please ask them well.
---------------------------------------------
Thank you for reading this post! These policies may seem tedious initially, but they’ll help us communicate and ensure you get the most effective help from the teaching staff.

We look forward to seeing you all soon! This is going to be a great semester!
<3 CS15 Staff"
other,"Question: Hello everyone!
SIS seems to have changed the timing of its grade publishing. I had anticipated grades being published tomorrow, but they are apparently now out. Well then!
Final course and exam grades have now been posted posted. See below for a description of each.
Course Grades
You can find these on SIS. Overall, the class did very well: 62% of students got an A- or better. Nicely done!
Grades were tabulated using the formula on the course admin page. For projects with multiple phases, design checkoffs counted for 5%, phase 1 code submissions counted for 10%, and final submissions counted for the remainder of the project grade (either 85% or 90%, depending on whether there was a design checkoff). This semester, we also decided to drop the lowest HW score. If this was a regular HW, the lowest score was dropped entirely. If it was a project, the score counted half as much.
Additionally, everyone received a 0.5% boost on their overall grade. This means that if you were on the border of getting a higher grade, you got the higher grade. Please do not email to ask for a higher grade—you already got the boost, and if this did not improve your grade, then you were not that close to the next highest grade.
Final Exam Grades
You can find these under the assignment titled ""Final exam score"" on Gradescope. The class also did very well here: the median score was 89%, and the average was 86.1%.
In keeping with the tradition of paper finals, we will not be releasing the exams themselves. If you would like to see your final exam, I will hold virtual office hours this Monday and Tuesday from 1-2pm each day in my zoom room: https://tufts.zoom.us/my/milod
You are also always welcome to stop by my office next semester.
Wrap up
And that's everything!
A huge thank you to the TAs for working diligently to ensure that everything is graded on time, and for making this course run so smoothly all semester long. And thanks to you all for a great semester—teaching this course is a great joy for me personally. If you ever want to chat, you know how to reach me.
Have a wonderful and restful summer break, put those laptops away for a while, and I'll see you around campus soon.
Cheers,
Milod"
other,"Question: Hi all,
I wanted to make you all aware of the StAAR Center as a resource for this course. They have subject tutors who can provide one-on-one tutoring for a number of courses, including CS 15. While the TAs and I are here to assist you, some students will find it valuable to have one or more extended, one-on-one sessions with a tutor, which is a resource that we alone may not be able to provide. These tutoring sessions can be extremely useful, especially if you find yourself struggling in this course. I've seen them work before!
If you are interested in scheduling a one-on-one session with a StAAR Center tutor you can do so through Tutor Finder, here: http://go.tufts.edu/tutorfinder
I have also attached an informational flier from them here: Final_Distribution_SPRING_2025_Menu_-_FINAL-1.pdf
Best,
Milod"
other,"Question: Hi everyone! I hope midterm studying is going well! Along with the midterm, every semester we ask for feedback on the course, so please help us out by filling out the following forms:

Midterm Course Feedback Form - https://tinyurl.com/sp25-cs15-midterm-eval
Midterm TA Feedback Form - https://tinyurl.com/cs15-sp25-ta-feedback 
This will help us improve the course for the rest of this semester and semesters to come!"
other,"Question: Hey folks,
One more reminder that course evaluations are due by the end of the day today: https://access.tufts.edu/blue-course-evaluations
These are a great help to me and the department, and you'll also want to do it to get your final grades early.
Happy studying,
Milod"
other,"Question: Is the score of one project equals to phase 1 plus phase 2?
Or phase 2 already includes the score from phase 1.
Answer: From the course admin page:
 Each project will comprise multiple installments submitted separately; that is, there may be an initial part of the project due one week, a more involved version a week later. We do not publicize the formula for combining the scores, but most of the score (80–90%) will come from the final submission."
other,"Question: Hey folks,
Course evaluations are now open—please fill these out! You can do so here: https://access.tufts.edu/blue-course-evaluations
The deadline is end-of-day on Thursday May 1st. These are really useful for assessing how the course is going for students. Also, you'll want to do this anyway to avoid getting your grades late.
Cheers,
Milod"
other,"Question: Hey folks,
We thought it might be fun to have a small competition for gerp submissions in terms of space/time performance on large Gutenberg. This is competition is totally optional. If you would like to compete, please upload your code files to the Gradescope assignment proj4_gerp_leaderboard – it should be the same files you provide to proj4_gerp.
As part of the uploading process, you will be able to choose a name for your group’s submission on the leaderboard. Once the submission has run through a few tests, you can see your position on the leaderboard by clicking on the ""Leaderboard"" tab in the top right of your submission. Note that there are a few correctness tests to ensure your results aren’t completely hacked - these correctness tests aren’t as thorough as the ‘normal’ ones, but if you fail any of them, you will not be placed on the leaderboard. We also reserve the right to inspect and remove any submissions that we deem fishy—so no funny business.
We won’t release the formula for calculating the score exactly, but notice that the reference scores ~1.0. The reference solution is already posted, see if you can beat it!
On the leaderboard page, you will be able to rank submissions based on RAM usage, index time, query time, or total score so you can see how your solution does in various categories. However, the winner will be selected based on the best (lowest) total score. The prize for the winning pair will be the Golden Duck Award (attached below).
You can submit to the leaderboard essentially as many times as you'd like (you're capped at 100). We will close submissions on Friday April 25 at 11:59pm — the same as the two token deadline (but you will not be charged tokens for the leaderboard).
Lastly, again, this is completely optional. Have fun!
Cheers,
Milod"

other,"Question: Hi all,
Prof. Mark Sheldon shared the below details on registering for CS 40, which I wanted to pass along to all of you:
Here’s the deal: CS 40 lecture section 1 and lab sections LA—LF is for declared CS majors (whose major declarations have already been processed) and post-baccs.  Non-majors, including those whose major declarations have not gone through and CS Minors, should register for lecture section 2 and lab section LW.  
At the end of registration, we’ll email further instructions to everyone then in lecture section 2.  We’ll hopefully just give everyone permission to join section 1 and regular labs, but, if there are too many, we’ll prioritize, possibly surveying students to find out more details.
Mark further added that they were able to enroll everyone who wanted to take the course this Spring, and will likely be able to do so again in the Fall.
Please do not email Mark asking for a way around these established rules. CS majors will get priority, then they'll do their best to admit everyone else.

other,"Question: For some reason, I think my Halligan account got un-synced to VSCode, because when I edit things in VSCode or make new files, it is not reflected in the terminal when I compile or run ls or cat, even though I'm command+s'ing.
I can navigate the terminal as though I'm looking at it from a few days ago; I can log in and cd into cs15 and run unit_test (which will run the tests written by yesterday) but anything afterwards doesn't register...
Is there a reason this could have happened out of the blue and is there a way to fix this? my sftp.json file still says my host is halligan and such, so I don't understand what the problem is or how to fix it...
  (The lab0 pdf on how to sync your account has been deleted/isnt accessible, so I'm not sure if the answer is there, but I figured I'd check here in case.)
Answer: Just as a note about the above response, vscode also saves version of your code for certain time intervals (like google docs edit history). It's under Timeline in the bottom left below the file section. So you should be able to rely on snapshot to save the remote version and timeline to save the local version."

JumboHack is a weekend-long hackathon hosted at Tufts, bringing together coders, designers, innovators, and creators from all walks of life to turn new ideas into reality. Over 48 hours, you'll team up, learn new skills, and hack together projects of your choosing—whether it’s a game, web app, mobile app, or something entirely new. 
No coding experience? No problem! Throughout the weekend, we’ll have an exciting lineup of workshops and tech talks led by Tufts alumni, your favorite Tufts clubs, and industry experts. Learn new skills in React, SQL, Terminal, web scraping, project management, and more, then apply what you’ve learned directly to your project. Whether you’re a seasoned programmer, interested in design, or just getting started, we have a submission track tailored for you, so you can build whatever your heart desires.
In addition, each track winner will walk away with a unique prize bundle, including prizes like a Nintendo Switch Lite, AirPods, air fryer, mini fridge, and more! And the most exciting part—the overall winner will be awarded $500!
Don't worry about going hungry while you code away—food will be provided to keep your energy levels up.
Interested? Fill out our signup form! If you don’t have a team yet, don’t worry—there will be time at the start of the event to meet other participants, share ideas, and form teams. For more information, check out jumbohack.org, email us at jumbohack@jumbohack.org, or follow/DM us @jumbo.hack on Instagram.
Can't wait to see you there!
With love, The JumboHack Team"

other,"Question: Hi all,
Yesterday in lecture section 1, someone asked what the ""Wshadow"" and ""Wpedantic"" flags for clang++ do. You can find a full list of clang's diagnostic flags, and a description of what they do, here: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html
In a nutshell, both of these flags provide more diagnostic warnings to the programmer. In the case of ""Wshadow"", using this flag causes the compiler to give you a warning anytime one declaration shadows another. For example, if I have a local variable named ""node"" and a global variable also named ""node"", we say the local shadows the global—with the ""Wshadow flag"", your compiler will warn you about such cases.
The ""Wpedantic"" flag causes the compiler to provide many additional warnings. I suggest checking out the link above to see the full list.
Cheers,
Milod"
other,"Question: Hi. I wanted to share a way in which you can run specific unit tests and not have to wait for all of them to compile (or comment out large blocks of code). The syntax (once correctly synced to Halligan) is: 
unit_test -n [TEST_NAME_1] [TEST_NAME_2] ...  [TEST_NAME_N]
For example, to test test_pushAtBack4 and test_pushAtBack5, you can run:
unit_test -n test_pushAtBack4 test_pushAtBack5
I didn't know this when I took the class, so it may be useful to somebody!"
other,"Question: As far as I know, this was not answered on the course website, but if it is, I'm sorry for the redundancy--
If we've used a late token to submit one day late, but are submitting for the first time, are we allowed to use the remaining 4 extra submissions to resubmit, or will this automatically use up another late token (even if it's still just one day after the usual due date)?
Answer: Tokens only allow you to extend the due date, not the number of submissions. If you use one token or two, you will always only have five total submissions.
So, yes, if you submit today, you can use your remaining submissions without losing another token."
other,"Question: Hi CS15! As a reminder, no line in your files can go beyond 80 characters. Thankfully, we have a simple solution for this!
Inserting a vertical ruler is a really easy and effective way to make sure you never go over 80 columns in a line in VSCode, and it takes only a minute to do. Go to settings, search up “ruler,” and click “edit in settings.json,” and then type “80” between the brackets next to “editor.rulers”:, save, and then you’re done! Whenever you’re typing, just make sure to start a new line before you get to the ruler.
REMINDER: the 80 char limit applies to all of the files that you submit, including the README.
Here’s a quick video that recaps what I just said: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTE0ec3IurE"
proj16,"Question: For CS11, Windows users could use PuTTY as their terminal to actually run and execute their programs. I know on the Admin page for this class it says we should use MobaXterm. Can I continue using PuTTY or should I switch to MobaXterm for some specific reason?
Answer: PuTTY is perfectly fine—as long as you have a terminal that allows you to access the homework server, you're good to go."
proj16,"Question: For some reason my auto grader went from running fine to saying my next submission had a build fail. However, when I run make MetroSim in my terminal it works perfectly fine? I’m confused at what led to this. It worked fine in my previous submission and I only added comments and finished my Read Me for the one that led to a build fail
Answer: Not sure what happened with make, but I just reran both of your submissions and your programs built. You should see your score now. Sorry about that!"
proj16,"Question: Hi- I'm a bit confused about the commands we can expect to take in our command/query loops.
In the spec it says the following:
You may assume input data is valid. (e.g., a Passenger will never want to go to a Station with a negative number, etc. . . ). Your program can do anything in such cases (segfault, quit, be angry, etc.).
However, the example sim is able to handle any input command data, giving output saying the command isn't recognized. 
Given that we're diffing with the example sim, should we be trying to handle these cases, or is the statement in the spec saying we should assume that the commands given in testing will always be ""m m"" or ""m f"" or ""p"" (followed by two numbers in range)?
Answer: Just like the spec said, you don't need to handle the case of invalid commands. This includes ill-formed p commands AND nonexistent commands. So yes, you can assume that you'll always be given m m, m f, or p with valid numbers."
proj16,"Question: when diffing, to see the output files in vscode to i run remote to local or local to remote? mine stay blank and dont update
Answer: Syncing remote to local will override your vscode version with the version in terminal. Local to remote will do the opposite (override terminal with the vscode version). So if you have output files that got filled when you ran the program remotely, to see those in vscode you should sync remote to local. You can also just cat the output file in terminal itself. Follow up if you have any syncing issues."
proj16,"Question: My terminal signs me out super quickly (like after less than a minute of inactivity), forcing me to have to re-sign in every minute. Is there a way to fix this? It just started yesterday."
proj16,"Question: For MetroSim testing (phase 2), do we need to have unit tests for each method or can we just make our own input files and submit those?
Answer: No, you don't need unit tests for each individual function. We encourage unit testing when possible, but for functions where it's difficult or not possible, you should rely on diff testing. And yes, please submit the input files you used to diff test as evidence of your testing."
proj16,"Question: Hello!

Could you please help me understand if it's possible to #include only <ios> to use all the stream types?
For example, can I include only <ios> to use ofstream, istream, and cin/cout in one file?

Additionally, I have included <ios> into my Passenger.h, PassengerQueue.h, and MetroSim.h.
Can I include <ios> only into Passenger.h if my PassengerQueue.h is using Passenger.h, and my MetroSim.h is using PassengerQueue.h

Thank you!
Answer: The ""ios"" library does not include the streams that you typically need (cin, cout, cerr, file stream, ...). Including ios alone will not be sufficient for most purposes. Rather, ios is a base class that the other stream classes build on top of.
To address your second question: typically, if your file uses some library, that file should directly include that library. You should do so even if some other code that you include already includes that library. The redundancy is fine—even if you could technically get away without it, it is could practice to directly include all libraries that your code needs. That way you are not dependent on some other code you are including being configured in a specific way. For example, if Passenger.h were to change and no longer need some specific library, we wouldn't want removing that library to indirectly break PassengerQueue.h and MetroSim.h. Include the code you need, and you will avoid such errors."
proj16,"Question: Hello! 
I was trying to turn in my homework on gradescope without unit_test because I did not write any unit tests and I got an error. Is it okay if I submit an empty unit_test file if I didn't write any unit_tests? 
Best, 
Osinachi Atama."
proj16,"Question: I know they close automatically when they go out of scope, but the spec says, ""Always remember to deallocate all previously heap-allocated memory and close all previously opened files before your program terminates!""
This causes an issue when using a general istream for input. Since std::istream doesn't have a close() method like std::ifstream does, how should we handle this? Is it fine to not explicitly close our streams?
Answer: You should absolutely close any files that are opened. This includes any input files that are later used as an istream in the program. The reason you don't need to explicitly close the general istream is because if just cin were used, this wouldn't require explicit closing. Valgrind should point out any files or streams that might be left open after the program finishes."
proj16,"Question: Can our open or die function be a public function? As passing it through another public function essentially allows the client the same level of access and I don't see how it would provide a level of 
abstraction.
Answer: Why does it need to be public? If all file handling, opening, and such is done in the MetroSim class, then there's no need for openOrDie to be public. On the other hand, if this handling is done in main, then MetroSim doesn't even need an openOrDie."
proj16,"Question: I keep running 'make' (and I have set up my MakeFile) but I keep getting this error ""error: linker command failed with exit code 1"", where there's an ""
undefined reference to `void MetroSim::tryToOpenFile<std::basic_ifstream<char, std::char_traits<char> > >(std::basic_ifstream<char, std::char_traits<char> >&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >)'"" when I try to call tryToOpenFile in my main.cpp file. Not sure how to fix this.
Answer: This may be an issue with how templates work. In short terms, any templated functions must be defined within the .h file of that class, or it may make sense to move those templated functions to be part of main.cpp"
proj16,Question: 
proj16,"Question: I had previously taken a cs class where we used auto and unsigned long data types, are we limited on the data types we are allowed to use?
Answer: It is fine to use unsigned long.
""auto"" is not a type, but rather a keyword which tells your compiler to infer the appropriate type. I'll quote from our style guide on this: ""The keyword auto should only be used when declaring variables of the iterator type. This is a Data Structures course — you're expected to develop a very strong grasp of which class, struct, or primitive data type you are working with at any given time."""
proj16,"Question: Hello! 

To test some of my MetroSim functions, I needed to make some of MetroSim's private variables public. Now, I made them private again.
When I run unit_test, it produces an error because some of my testing functions are trying to access the private variables.

What would you recommend me to do with such tests?

I planned to comment them, but then recalled that previous specs asked to uncomment all of our tests.

Thank you!"
proj16,"Question: My code is opening the output file, and yet when I am trying to write onto it, it just isn't writing onto it, I even commented out all of my calls to the rest of the program and just opened an output file and tried to write one thing onto it and it wouldn't write onto the file, despite it opening and I'm not entirely sure why I am not able to. The demo file is able to modify the output files, so it seems to be my code but I don't understand how.
Answer: resolved in private piazza post"
proj16,"Question: Hello!

I would appreciate if you could advise me on writing a proper header for main.cpp
Would it be appropriate to write ""This file contains functions that allow the client to build and use MetroSim through the command line.""

Thank you!
Answer: The style guide mentions what we expect, which can be found here
Take a look at the ""internal documentation"" for more info. Making this public in case someone else has a similar question."
proj16,Question: Are we expected to handle as many edge cases as possible for the project or can we expect our program to only be tested with valid input?
proj16,"Question: Are we allowed to use the getline() function to read from input files?
Answer: Yes
[Edit: making public so students with the same question can see the answer]"
proj16,"Question: Hello! 
I have not been able to find a way to comment out a header in my input test files. The usual ""//"" and ""#"" symbols do not work for txt files. Is it sufficient to just describe each file in my README or is there a way to add this header? 
Thank you. 
Answer: Because txt files don't contain any code, there's no standard way for creating comments within them. But regardless, you should definitely be describing what the testing files test for in the README under the section with the other files."
proj16,"Question: Hello,
It seems that, upon providing an invalid file name for the .txt file containing the station names, the reference program quits without creating a file with the name designated as the output file, while my program quits, but still creates this file (it is just empty). Would this difference be something that is causing an error with the autograder?
Thanks
Answer: Hmmm, I doubt this would affect the autograder? But it seems to just be a difference of order of operations between your program and the reference. I would recommend mimicking what the reference does, because if the program can't run due to faulty arguments then the user shouldn't be stuck with an empty file despite the program never actually running."
proj16,"Question: Hello! 
I ran into a weird bug while trying to read from a test station file. When I input data from my stations file, it works pretty fine if it is the stations file we were provided, but when I try to create my own stations file, I get this scenario where the text on my line is being pushed to the next line and even possibly eaten up after I print something from the stations file. After a lott of printing outputs to debug and searching for information online, I found that there is a carriage return character being automatically put at the end of every line in the stations file. I have never encountered this problem before, but apparently, it is something that happens to windows users. Do I have to manually try to remove it using a for loop through every string or is there some other method that I could use? 

Here is an image for better understanding : 
Also, as you can see in the image of the text files below, it's not a whitespace issue. "
proj16,"Question: Is it fine if we use variables like $@ and $< to build our Makefile?
Answer: As long as you understand what these do and how to use them, then yes that's fine."
proj16,"Question: For instance, in our main.cpp file, if it only directly references MetroSim.cpp, should we only write #include ""MetroSim.h"", or should we add all .h files that MetroSim.h also indirectly references?

Is it correct that we should only #include one .h file per .cpp file, like MetroSim.cpp only having #include ""MetroSim.h""? 

Should .h files include all other .h files that they indirectly reference? For example, if we only have Passenger, PassengerQueue, and a MetroSim classes, should MetroSim.h have #include ""PassengerQueue.h"" and #include ""Passenger.h"", even though #include ""Passenger.h"" is already referenced in PassengerQueue.h?"
proj16,"Question: Hello! 
Do we have to make the colors of our indicies the same as the blue color of the station's indices here? If so, how do we achieve that please? 
Thank you! "
proj16,"Question: I'm trying to create functions in MetroSim and use them in my main.cpp file, but to do this I need to make the functions static. Can I do this?
Answer: If the function is part of the MetroSim class, can you instead create an instance of a MetroSim in main and then call the function on that instance?"
proj16,"Question: Right now, all of my functions (so, a lot of functions) in the MetroSim class are public. All of the variables are private. I'm assuming it's better to have at least some functions private, but generally, how do we decide which functions should be public and which private? Should all of the functions be private except for those that are called by other classes/main? Thanks!
Answer: Elias is right, the only things (variables and functions) that should be left private are the ones that clients have a use for. If it's at all possible for a client to misuse the functionality of your program by calling method you've left public, make it private!"
proj16,"Question: I was a little confused about this line in the README - what does it imply about our submission? It's listed in between the files that were submitted and the Data Structures section. Thanks
Answer: You can just remove that from your version of the README. I assume it just means that your program should behave as expected with all valid input and should be tested thoroughly to ensure this. Put a description of any submitted test files in the README as well."
proj16,"Question: If we diff our output with the example program, should we submit those text files and command files we use to test?
Answer: From the ""Submitting"" section of the spec:

""You must also submit:
• Any unit tests you write for your program. This may be done in a file called unit_tests.h, using the unit_test framework that we have used on past assignments. Alternatively, you can create your own testing main functions, e.g., submit a file called MetroSim_tests.cpp with a main function that calls out to tests. Whatever testing files you use, you must submit them!
• Any command files (excluding the command file provided).""
You only need to submit the command files that you used to test, not the output text files!"
proj16,"Question: If we write functions for the sole purpose of unit testing (ie getters), should we comment those out / delete them before we submit? Is it bad to have code in our submission that isn't actually needed to run the program?
Answer: You can comment these out and just leave a comment above them that says they were used for testing. This leaves more evidence of testing for the graders. Please do not leave them uncommented if they are not needed for your actual program."
proj16,"Question: I understand that we shouldn't use namespace std in .h files, but is it fine to do so in .cpp files to conserve time and space?
Answer: That is fine!"
proj16,"Question: Hello,
It seems that the size function for std::vector returns a type other than an int, leading me to get this compiler warning message
MetroSim.cpp:58:22: warning: comparison of integers of different signs: 'int' and 'size_type' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Wsign-compare]
   58 |     for(int i = 0; i < stations.size(); i++) {

The code still works for what I am currently testing, but I always get this warning message. Is that ok? Or is the autograder impacted by warning messages like this? Should I resolve this in some way?
Thank you!
Answer: The autograder will not be affected by this. You can make the warning message go away by typecasting the size to an int. This would look something like: 
i < (int) stations.size();"
proj16,"Question: Near the end of CS 11, we were told to keep as little code as possible in our main functions and delegate most of the logic and implementation to other classes. Does the same notion apply to CS 15? If so, would it be acceptable for main to handle file reading, interactions with other classes, and the command loop, or would that be considered too much for main.cpp?
Answer: Overall, we do encourage having as little code as possible in main (30 line limit in accordance with the style guide), but we also want you to think about abstraction barriers and modularity (as in classes should only handle the information relevant to them). Depending on your implementation, it could make sense to have your command loop in main, as long as you ensure private variables aren't directly accessible. Generally speaking, if you keep abstraction/modularity in mind and stay under 30 lines, you should be fine. We see a variety of solutions!"
proj16,"Question: Is there a phase 2 spec that dictates what functions our Train and other classes should have? If not, how are we supposed to know what to name our functions and what parameters to give them so that the autograder can properly use them?
Answer: There is no separate phase 2 spec, all the info you need is in the overall MetroSim spec. Because the design of your program outside of Passenger and PassengerQueue is entirely up to you, we have no requirements for functions that any other classes must have. You should follow the style guide for how to name functions (just give them a name that is descriptive for what it does). We will compile your code using the Makefile that you create and submit since not all students have the same class design. The autograder will then run that version that is compiled with your own Makefile."
proj16,"Question: Is it ok to use Milod's open_or_die code from the file_io slides in my project, as long as I credit him in the function declaration and README?
Answer: Yes, that is allowed."
proj16,"Question: Hi, I'm getting an error in my terminal when I try to do ./MetroSim, even though the makefile is compiling my program without errors. it just tells me that the command ./MetroSim was not found. This also applies to when I provide it with the correct format, such as ./MetroSim stations.txt output.txt
Answer: If you ls, do you see MetroSim as a valid executable? It seems like your Makefile isn't correctly producing the executable. Take a look at the Makefile lab and past assignments and make sure the rules follow the same format."
proj16,"Question: Do we have to check if the station numbers are correct when we construct a passenger object? For example, if I made my starting station 3000, what error should I throw?
Answer: The Passenger objects are independent of the stations. The station is a client of Passenger (it uses instances of the Passenger or PassengerQueue class, not the other way around). So there would be no way for you to check within Passenger.cpp whether the given arrival and departure stations are in fact valid stations since the passenger has no clue what a valid station even means! If someone were to misuse an instance of Passenger by giving it a station that doesn't exist, then that's their problem, not Passenger's.
TLDR: no
[EDIT: After reading your question a second time, I can't tell if you were asking whether the Passenger class should check that it's being constructed with valid station numbers, or if the station numbers should be checked for validity within your outer MetroSim functionality. So if it's the first option, then my answer above stands. If it's the second one, follow up with a bit more info and we can go from there!]"
proj16,"Question: For the README submission, should our answers only reflect what we have done for Phase 1? Like when asked about files should we only include files submitted in this phase?"
proj16,"Question: Hello everyone! 
For MetroSim, can we assume that we are always expected to redirect output to the output file and never to std:cout? It seems so on the spec, as the only optional argument from the terminal should be the command file.
Answer: I would recommend re-reading the part of the spec that explains the ""metro move"" command and running the simulation! There should be output to both the terminal and the output file."
proj16,"Question: Hi I'm getting this error, but my code was working fine before and I didn't make changes to my makefile:

make: Warning: File 'train.cpp' has modification time 0.53 s in the future
make: warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.
And now my code is not functioning as expected.
Answer: make knows to recompile when train.cpp's modification time is more recent than the times of the executables that depend on it. However, it looks like the modification time of one of your executables is more recent than train.cpp's. You can fix it by rebuilding everything with make clean, then make. If that doesn't work, try touch *, which will update the timestamps of everything in your current directory."
proj16,"Question: Does the makefile also have an 80 character line limit? If so, how can we split up the lines?
Answer: Yes, it's good to keep the Makefile under that limit. You can use a backslash (\) to split the lines up: 

target: dependencies1 dependencies2 \
        dependencies3 dependencies4 ...
       recipe"
proj16,"Question: Since the metrosim provided creates an output file that, do we also have to create an output file if it dosen't exist?
Answer: Yes, but the good news is that this is easily done with ofstream"
proj16,"Question: Do we need to handle the case where not enough files are provided by the user ?
Answer: Yes. Please refer to the spec for the exact error message to output for this case."
proj16,"Question: If we wanted to start implementing the remaining classes for MetroSim that should be in Phase 2 to get ahead, would it be fine if we include commented out unit tests for them in the unit test file(s) that we submit for Phase ?"
proj16,"Question: Are we solely being graded on functionality via the auto-grader, or are we also being graded on questions in our README, header and in-line comments, the 80 character limit, and other style guidelines?
Answer: Phase 1 is just autograder results. The autograder might implicitly count some style stuff like the use of &&, ||, 80 character limit, etc. We won't be reading the README or checking for inline comments per se. That being said, it's probably in your best interest to write inline comments as you go, and to do your best to keep the phase 1 submission to the 15 style guide since you'll be using this code in your final project as well (and we will check it for style then)."
proj16,"Question: To clarify, the deliverables for phase one are:
Passenger.h
Passenger.cpp
PassengerQueue.h
PassengerQueue.cpp
metro_design_checkoff.txt

Is that correct? 
Also, do we need to submit evidence of testing?
Answer: Elias is right. But you will need evidence of testing of phase 1 code during the final submission, so might as well do it now!"

Answer: Yes, 5 submissions for phase 1 and 5 submissions for phase 2."
proj16,"Question: gradescope says it didn't contain any code, so it's not allowing me to submit."
proj16,"Question: Hi,
Does the Queue/List of passengers on the train need to be a PassengerQueue or can it be an ArrayList/Vector? I know the stations need to be represented as PassengerQueues but I was not sure about the representation of the passengers on the train. Thank you!"
proj16,"Question: Hello,
Is it generally best practice to #include .h files and libraries every time, even if not necessary, for clarity? Or is it unnecessary/redundant?
For example, if my Passenger.h file has #include <iostream>, and my PassengerQueue.h file has  #include ""Passenger.h"", do I not technically have to #include <iostream> in PasengerQueue? And if not, should I still generally do it, since it could be confusing once I have files including files that include files that include files, etc. ?"
proj16,"Question: I am using a list for the passenger queue, and to print I need to iterate through the list, can I use range-based for loop, because I can't access each element within the list.

Answer: Yes, please see @160"
proj16,"Question: I was reading through some of the member types and functions included in the vector library on cplusplus and saw that size_t is a member type used to represent any non-negative integer. I wondered if using size_t rather than ints when making for loops would be better. Are there any other differences between int and size_t? Or could I use size_t instead of int?
Answer: Good question! Just like you said, size_t is simply a non-negative integer. It's important to note though that occasionally this can pose some issues related to casting. For example, if I have some variable ""int x"" that I think is positive but somehow became negative, and I return x from a function with return type size_t (or some other casting scenario), I am now actually returning a number that I probably don't want. Because when my code tries to turn a negative integer into a non-negative size_t, it'll do some conversions that can cause unexpected behavior.
That said, you probably won't be using size_t a ton in this class aside from seeing it as the return type of some standard library functions. In which case, keep my casting note above in mind when you call and save the results of these functions.
I guess it's up to you then whether you use size_t instead of int as your iterator for for loops. You do have complete control over what your ""int i"" is for the entirety of your for loop, so it's not like there's a chance it might randomly become negative and you want some built in check to always keep it positive."
proj16,"Question: The spec for Project 1 says that we must use std::vector or std::list to represent the passengerQueue, but also gives a specific list of public functions to adhere to. I understand that std::vector and std::list have built-in functionality (far exceeding the specified functionality). Is the idea to use a std::vector, for example, and then build the listed public functions ourselves to use instead of the other built-in things?"
proj2,"Question: Are we allowed to use range-based for loops for iterating through lists as shown below?

Answer: I'm currently running the reference with that input and I'm not getting the same result. It outputs that '{#t' and '}' are unimplemented and then an empty stack error and continues taking input. Could you clarify which command you think is causing the error? It is correct that an rstring without a whitespace after the brace will result in those errors, but I'm not sure why the reference would stop taking input for you"
proj2,"Question: When I run the autograder, it says the build failed, but I pass most of the autograder tests and receive points for them. How is this possible?
Answer: Build Failed can refer to specific tests that failed to build rather than the entire program itself failing to build. This can happen for many reasons. Are you able to see the the ""Build Fail"" output and interpret it? That could give you a clue as to what you can do to fix it!"
proj2,"Question: Do we need to create a function to throw and catch errors to reduce repetitive code. It seems like it would entail passing a function as an argument but I don't think we know how to do that yet. Are we expected to make a function to handle this repetitive code?
Answer: Throwing errors happens in different settings and is only one line of code, so I think creating a function for it may be redundant/unnecessary. As for catching errors, remember that a try catch can catch any errors your program throws in the block of code within the ""try{...}"" part of it. Is there a specific place that you can put this try/catch that would make it so you only have to have it once?"
proj2,"Question: The spec references both the runtime error ""datum_not_rstring"" and the cerr message ""Error: cannot execute non rstring\n"". What is the difference between these and in which case(s) do we use each one?3
Answer: Calling some of the functions in Datum.h can throw runtime errors like ""datum_not_rstring"" and your program must catch these. The cerr message above is just something your program needs to print if exec is called on a non-rstring."
proj2,"Question: Hello,
Is there a good way to allow an istream to continue getting input after a newline for parseRString? For example:
{
2 3 }
My istream currently just stops after the '{' due to the newline, and I don't know how to get it to keep reading. It's able to read in { 2 3 } perfectly fine. If this is something we're supposed to figure out ourselves, that's fine too. 
Answer: In parseRString, what function are you using to read in from the stream? Also, we tested parseRString for rstrings with newlines in phase 1 (test 22). Have you changed your function since then? If not, the bug could be coming from somewhere else."
proj2,"Question: Hello! 
I wanted to ask, can we assume that every rString parsed from the terminal most have the closing braces - ""}""? 
Because when I tested this on the reference implementation, it could not print out anything 

Thank you!"
proj2,"Question: Hi! I'm trying to manage removing curly braces and trailing/leading spaces from strings for some of my helper functions. is it okay to use substring to get the smaller, correct string, and find_first_of / find_last_of to detect spaces?
Answer: Yes, you can use substring()!"
proj2,"Question: Will we lose points if we do not use the datum operator< and operator== in our comparison methods in RPNCalc? I have already written my methods without them, and I want to ensure there is no penalty for this.
Answer: Yes, as the student answer suggests, I'd advise using the existing < operator—it should make your code cleaner and more concise than ""extracting"" the ints from the Datum objects then comparing."
proj2,"Question: I'm running into this issue using dash like in the lab. When I look in VS Code at my.stderr it says it's a binary file. When I cat into the output, it looks the same as my reference"
proj2,"Question: I don't understand why we need dup and swap in our program because I can't think of a scenario when we need it. Can someone explain?
Answer: You can take a look at the starter file fib.cyl for an example of a program that uses both!"
proj2,"Question: I'm not sure how to quit as in Metrosim I quit in the main function with ""return;"" However I don't know to quit the program within a private helper function. Should I just do ""exit(0)""? Is that ok?
Answer: This is a tricky problem with a few different solutions. Remember that if your helper functions are in the same class, they can share information with each other through private variables."
proj2,"Question: At least for my program, there are 16 potential commands (or types of commands like arithmetic operators or inequalities). If I use an if-else structure and have each conditional call a helper function, that still exceeds the 30-line function limit. Would I be allowed to put the helper function on the same line as the conditional? Or is there a better way to break it up without damaging the functionality?
This is what I mean by the ""helper function on the same line"" statement:
if (condition1) { condition1Helper(); }
else if (condition2) { condition2Helper(); }
else if (condition3) { condition3Helper(); }
...
else { error(); }
run code snippetVisit Manage Class to disable runnable code snippets×
And if I were to take that approach, would it be bad if I broke the pattern for calling helper functions with long conditions?
Otherwise, how does one modularize the commands loop?
Thank you!"
proj2,"Question: Hello everyone! 
I wanted to ask, do we also have to test our calcYouLater code using .cylc file or can we do it using .txt files? 
Thank you. 
Answer: Both file types are ok. Just make sure to submit and document them (i.e., briefly describe what they test for in your README)."
proj2,"Question: Do we decide what name we use for the function for the math operations like +-x/?
Answer: Yep, you can name these functions whatever you like"
proj2,"Question: hi! i was wondering why for some of the functions we're instructed to throw errors, catch them and continue, and for some functions we're told to not do any exception throwing. Because if you're catching exceptions, doesn't it continue anyway? So why for some functions are we instructed to only print the message instead."
proj2,"Question: hi! am i able to use istringstream for unit testing purposes? that way i can test reading in from an input stream in my files but dont have to open/create other files or provide input myself manually?
Answer: Absolutely! This is a fantastic way to test input streams in unit_test and I highly recommend this to students in office hours. Keep it up!
Additionally, make sure to create .cyl and corresponding .cylc files for your final submission.

EDIT: I'm making this public in case others have similar questions"
proj2,"Question: anyone else having issues with autograder? mine has been running for over ten minutes now with no result.
Answer: Resolved"
proj2,"Question: Do I need to consider whether the user will try and create a DatumStack from an array with a different size (greater or less) than the number Datums in the array? I ask only because the interface description requires a thrown error for the top function and not the array constructor. I am have no problem with doing nothing (as the spec implies) and assuming the user always uses the constructor correctly, but depending on implementation if the user asks for more Datums than there are in the array then a memory access error would arise.
Answer: You can assume the correct values are passed into the constructor."
proj2,"Question: When I run [ make unit_test ], it comes up with this error:
make: *** No rule to make target 'unit_test_driver.o', needed by 'unit_test'.  Stop.
My Makefile also should be formatted correctly as I referenced previous assignments. I recieved this error after submitting MetroSim the last time, and it hasn't fixed itself in the time since."
proj2,"Question: Can our run function or the function that contains our query loop be longer than 30 lines?
Answer: Although the student answerer has the right idea, for this project, we're okay with the command/query loop being over 30 lines (unless you're using lambdas, which we discourage anyways)!"
proj2,"Question: hello. how can I make the unit_tests makefile if I can't use unit_tests.cpp for the unit_test.o? In the previous projects, the unit_test_driver.o had been made for us so I don't know how I can make the unit_tests.o if I am not allowed to use unit_tests.h in my compiling?
Answer: resolved"
proj2,"Question:  Should the ‘Simpler’ RPNCalc Commands be public functions? Or are the only public functions the default constructor and run? Can I add helper functions in private as well? I am asking because of this:
""The names of your functions / methods as well as the order
 and types of parameters and return types of the interface of
 the DatumStack and RPNCalc classes and the parseRString
 functions defined above must be exactly as specified""
Answer: Per the important note in the spec on page 15: ""For the two classes (DatumStack and RPNCalc), you may not have any other public functions."" You can always have as many private helper functions as you need to complete the assignment though, just keep them private!"
proj2,"Question: I am continuously failing parser - ints after closing brace, but am not sure why since the outputs seem the same. I know sometimes this happens with an extra space so I was wondering if when returning there should be a space at the end after the brace? For example:
 ""{ 1 1 + } "" instead of what I have now, which is ""{ 1 1 + }"". This is the only explanation I can come up with since I have unit tested it and it seems correct if there is not meant to be a space after the closing bracee. Thanks!"
proj2,"Question: Hello! 
I submitted my files and passed all the tests for rStrings except the one below. I don't know how to fix it because the outputs look the same. 
Any thoughts on how to handle this? 
Answer: I would recommend looking at the name of the test and the output to then try to test that same case separately in your terminal. Adding print statements and using other debugging techniques might be helpful in this case!"
proj2,"Question: Is it necessary for us to include error handling for cases like division by zero?
The reference implementation does, but the spec says nothing of the sort, so I wanted to confirm.
Answer: From the spec: 

""We expect your program to never crash. This means you must test for possible edge cases. If you come up with an edge case, you MUST use the reference implementation to determine what the behavior of your program should be for that case, as we will be using the reference, and the exact error messages for grading your assignment."""
proj2,Question: I was wondering how I would go about unit testing the run and print functions in RPNCalc? Both functions don't modify the DatumStack in any way that I can test with assert statements. Print only sends information to cout which I can't capture with unit tests. Is it required to have a unit test for every function or is it okay to skip certain functions like these?
proj2,"Question: Hello everyone! 
I was wondering, for the parseRstring class, can we assume that it will always get a string with valid parentheses, or do we have to write code to cover for cases that are not valid? 
Thank you! "
proj2,"Question: Hi I just wanted to make sure that we do not need to implement the big three in our DatumStack class.
Answer: And in the future, please check Piazza to see if your question has already been asked and answered before posting it again"
proj2,"Question: There are no slots left for all of Wednesday, and I'm in class for the 2 available slots for today.
Are there any more slots available? Will there be any more available, especially on Wednesday? 

I don't have a design checkoff slot. I have also found duplicate names and am unsure what to do.

Answer: I didn't plan on adding anymore more slots, so please come to office hours and add your name to the queue. A TA will check you off when they are available."
proj2,"Question: Hi, I was wondering if we were allowed to use std::list or std::vector in our parser.cpp file?
Answer: Yes, that's fine"
proj2,"Question: Are we allowed to use unordered maps and lambda functions in our CalcYouLater program?
Answer: It's great that you're thinking along these lines—but I'd ask that you avoid using these as they are not things we have learned about in class (and in the case of lambdas, many of our TAs have not learned about them either)."
proj2,"Question: Hello,
It says in the spec that for phase 1 of CalcYouLater we must submit a unit_tests.h. Will we be graded on these tests (the contents of this file)? Or will the phase 1 grade just be like MetroSim (i.e. only autograder score)
Answer: For this project and the rest, phase 1 will only be the autograder score"
proj2,"Question: The spec says we ""may not use std::stack or any other built-in facility that would render the assignment trivial.""
Does this include std::vector and std::list? Are we allowed to use these?"
proj2,"Question: Depending on the data structures we use to implement the stack, there may be nothing within the DatumStack class that we would have to intentionally initialize in our default constructor. However, the spec states that we must have a default constructor. Do we need to still include an essentially empty function in our DatumStack.cpp file? Thank you!
Answer: Yes, please include a default constructor, even if it is just empty."
proj2,"Question: After testing I moved my private methods back to private, and of course, the unit_test is now buggy. Should I comment on all those buggy tests or can I leave them there?"
proj2,"Question: Hi, I'm trying to figure out the input file type "".cylc"" for project 2. In the spec, it said ""RPNCalc runs on files with extension .cylc."" Does this mean we need to check if the input file type is .cylc and cerr if it's not, or is it assumed that we'll have .cylc filename inputs?
Answer: No, you don't need to have a specific check for file extensions."
proj2,"Question: hey! I'm wondering if we would need the big 3 for the DatumStack class. I know the spec says ""if necessary"" but I wanted to clarify with some other people. I feel like we would need to write big 3 functions because we write our own constructors for the DatumStack class, but like with the PassengerQueue class, because we are using built-in list/vector libraries which do have big 3 already I feel like we wouldn't need to write them ourselves. What do you guys think?"
proj2,"Question: Hello! 
I am posting to confirm that we should not and do not get a datum.cpp file in our folder when we run the special copy command. 
Please confirm. 
Thank you! 
Answer: You should not receive Datum.cpp. We give you Datum.o, the compiled version of Datum.cpp—but not the original source code itself."
proj2,"Question: The spec states that the Parser class (.h and .cpp) should ""contain the declaration and definition of one function called parseRString"" - does this mean we can add other functions to make our code more efficient, or are we restricted to ONLY that one function?
Answer: Note: parser.h does not contain a parser class, and you should not create one either. Otherwise, the autograder will fail because it won't be able to run your parseRString(). parser.h only contains the function declaration. That being said, you can create helper functions, but to follow the spec's instructions, you should declare and define them in the .cpp file, not the .h."
proj2,"Question: The CYL spec states the following:
""A push function that takes a Datum element and puts it on the top of the stack.""
Can we assume that the return type of this function should be void since it was not explicitly stated unlike the other functions?
Answer: Yes, it should be void. We'll make a note to add that in the spec for next semester. Thanks for pointing it out!"
proj2,"Question: Around when can we expect to receive our grades for MetroSim? Would this be before Phase 0 and 1 of CalcYouLater are due?
Answer: We will not have grading of MetroSim done before Phase 1 of CalcYouLater is due next Wednesday 2/26. This shouldn't pose much of an issue though since you do have grades back for the design checkoff and phase 1 of MetroSim already."
proj3,"Question: Hi all,
Project 2 has been released. You can find it in the usual place on the course website. We will also have a mini-lecture in class tomorrow that establishes some groundwork knowledge you'll need for the project.
As always, I highly recommend that you start early. We give you two weeks because it is significantly more manageable in that time frame.
Once again, there are multiple phases to this project. Phase 0 (the design checkoff) and phase 1 are due next Wednesday, Feb. 26, by 11:59pm. As before, please sign up for a design checkoff slot with a TA, using this link.
The final project is due in two weeks, Tuesday March 4th by 11:59pm.
Finally, remember to extensively test your implementation before submitting. We have once again provided you with a reference implementation—you must diff test against this implementation to get a good autograder score.
Have fun with it!
Cheers,
Milod"

” for multiple tests but I don’t really know what this means. I don’t have a read file method in my code or any runtime errors that throw the given message.
Answer: This error means that when you call the BinaryIO::readFile() function (one of the functions that we provide you with), you are calling it on a file that was not actually compressed with zap. Make sure you are calling zap with a file that you actually compressed with your zap program, and make sure that that is also the file you are calling readFile on."
proj3,"Question: I tried submitting my zap assignment but it says autograder failed and to contact course staff. What should I do?
Answer: I've rerun the autograder for you, so you should see the score soon. In the future, you can just resubmit if the autograder fails to run (the bad one won't count as a submission)."
proj3,"Question: If we have to throw a runtime error, is it necessary to clean up memory before throwing? For instance, if we receive a bad zap file and throw the “Encoding did not match Huffman tree.” error but have some uncleaned memory afterward, is that acceptable?"
proj3,"Question: For my first submission to phase one, I can see both my (red, left) output and the correct (green, right) output for each test, like pictured below.
On subsequent submissions, however, I can't see this detail:
Is there a way to see this, or is this difference intentional? I wrote a unit test for this specific test and passed that. I'm not sure what to do re additional testing; I'm wondering what the autograder reads my output to be so I can fix the function accordingly. 
Answer: Hi, taking a look at your autograder results, it seems like you seg faulted on all of those tests. I would take a look at the autograder results, which should have just been released.
For some of the tests, it looks like you segfault, which may or may lead to incorrect output files. I’d start there."
proj3,"Question: Hello! 
I was wondering, is it okay if my output file from the encode function is a text file? Because I noticed that the bad_zap_file does not have the "".txt"" extension. And if I make it a txt file, does that change anything?"

proj3,"Question: I saw on gradescope we are required to submit a unittest.h file, should i just submit an empty unittest file if i weren't using unit test as a measure of testing?
Answer: If you didn't use unit testing for phase 1 or 2, then yes, you can submit an empty unit_tests.h file. Of course, make sure you do submit some kind of evidence of testing (a testing main, input files, etc.)"
proj3,"Question: Hello,
I wrote some test .txt files and tried to compare my zap and the_zap. However, for a specific .txt file, there was a seg fault from the reference implementation while my zap succeeded in compressing it. 
I then tried unzapping the .zap file compressed by my zap using both the_zap and my zap, and the resulting .txt file did pass the diff test. I wonder if we should expect seg faults from the_zap in some instances. (I attached a screenshot from my terminal) 
Thank you!
Answer: What's in the text file?"
proj3,"Question: Just to clarify since we don't need to implement a destructor, does that also mean that we won't need to worry about passing valgrind in phase 2?
Thanks!
Answer: No, you should always free any memory your program allocates and run valgrind to check for this. There are other ways to free memory without a destructor (e.g., a helper function, within a function, etc.), so that's why the spec doesn't require it."
proj3,"Question: Can we use the system() command in a main() function for testing to reduce terminal commands?
Answer: Using it is fine in terms of our course policies, but I'd advise you take Hameedah's suggestion into consideration! Presumably, you'd just be using system() calls to invoke some bash commands that would run your tests. You can skip the middleman, and just write bash code instead that you invoke directly. As Hameedah mentioned, writing bash scripts is a very useful skill that will pay dividends down the road."
proj3,"Question: As stated in the spec, we should throw a runtime error for a few specific issues, such as attempting to open a file that doesn’t exist.
In these cases, is it acceptable to leave the program to crash immediately without catching the errors?"
proj3,"Question: I have found it useful for checking if a file exists or if its size is empty. Are we allowed to use it, or should we implement those checks with an istream?
Answer: Sure, that is fine."
proj3,"Question: I constructed a Huffman Tree based on the word banana on my terminal-
Does it matter if it's ILaILbLn or ILaLnLb or is it the same?"
proj3,"Question: I understand that level-order trees are good practice, however I know that the method in which I implemented the helper function to serialize the tree in my encoder function does output a valid huffman tree (the characters' encodings take up the same amount of space as the valid one). Should I revise this function to make it more like the reference tree or is this okay?
Answer: As noted in the spec, there can be many valid Huffman trees for a particular input text. As long as your resulting encoding size is the same, it is fine if your tree is different from the reference implementation's tree. Make sure to test on many different inputs to ensure that this is the case."

proj3,"Question: Hello! 
I am aware we are not allowed to use generative AI in writing code for this class but is it okay if we use AI to generate the different kinds of text length and character variety that will be useful in testing our code?

proj3,"Question: I am trying to finish up part one for the project but whenever I type in my password after

Answer: Other TAs, feel free to add on, but I'm not sure what the problem is. Maybe try restarting your computer? If that doesn't fix it, you can also try the lab computers to see if you can login on there. 
I'm making this public because another student may have experienced this issue and can help."
proj3,"Question: Hello,
I don't know if anyone has encountered problems like this, but my vscode treats my README as code by highlighting syntax errors. I haven't figured out how to reset it so that README would be only plain text, and I appreciate it if anyone has a solution to this. Thanks!"
proj3,"Question: Hi, 

I was wondering if for testing phase 1, we could use both unit tests and another main function, or if we had to choose one and use that for all tests/functions."
proj3,"Question: Can we assume for Part One that our code will only be tested on valid HuffmanTrees (i.e. no random floating internal nodes, nullptr endings off of internal nodes, etc.)?"
proj3,"Question: Hello!
Since count_freqs is void and the cout statements may differ in order, would it be sufficient to test this function by printing out expected vs actual output and visually comparing the two in the terminal?
Thanks,
Arietta
Answer: Yes, that's fine. Just be sure to describe this process in the testing section of your README."
proj3,"Question: I saw this in the spec, I'm not very sure what it means ""newline's frequency is reported across two lines.
Answer: It just means that the strange gap in the list of character frequencies represents a newline character."
proj3,"Question: For converting the string back to tree do we need to care about the frequency in contructing new nodes?
If they don't have a frequency are we alsoing using /0 like the value?
Answer: Because the frequency isn't something that's encoded into the serialized text, you can just set the frequency to 1 or some other constant value."
proj3,"Question: The spec says differences in ordering for the frequency counting is allowed - just curious how this works with the autograder for part 1?
Answer: The autograder first sorts all lines of output from your implementation, then compares it to the expected sorted result. Sorting gets rid of any discrepancies in ordering."
proj3,"Question: are we allowed to use auto to print out characters and their count?
Answer: Range-based for loops are okay, but please be aware of what the style guide says:
The keyword auto should only be used when declaring variables of the iterator type. This is a Data Structures course — you're expected to develop a very strong grasp of which class, struct, or primitive data type you are working with at any given time."
proj3,"Question: Does the order in which the frequencies are printed matter? My function uses std::map and seems to print whitespace and \n before the letters, but in the spec those are printed after."
proj3,"Question: Is it fine if what is printed to cout by count_freqs has a trailing new line?
For instance, the spec states that BaNana should be as below, resulting in 4 lines:
B: 1
a: 3
N: 1
n: 1
Is it fine if our count_freqs() instead prints as below, resulting in 5 lines?:
B: 1
a: 3
N: 1
n: 1
Answer: You should follow the spec to the best of your ability. If you choose the latter option, you may fail many autograder tests for phase 1, which would not be advisable."
proj3,"Question: I understand that the spec states we can declare and define helper functions for phase one. However, I would like to clarify whether this means we are allowed to add additional function definitions to phaseOne.h and phaseOne.cpp, in addition to the three required functions."
proj3,"Question: I noticed that the spec states that we should have a function defined as ""HuffmanTreeNode *deserialize_tree(const std::string &serial_tree)"" for phase 1.
In the phaseOne.h file that we were provided in the starter code, it defines this same function as ""HuffmanTreeNode *deserialize_tree(const std::string &s);"", which names the string reference parameter as s instead of serial_tree.
Should we change the .h file to match the spec?
Answer: Thanks for pointing this out, we'll make a note about this for next semester!
But, no, you don't have to change the parameter's name. As long as the function name, return type, and parameter count and types match the spec (i.e., your declaration and definitions match), the autograder will have no problem calling your functions."
proj3,"Question: Are things like function contracts, header comments, and in-line comments going to be accounted for in our phase 1 submission, or will that only be for phase 2?
Answer: As is true for all projects, phase 1 is just the autograder score."
proj3,"Question: Will our unit tests (or main functions used for testing) be graded on modularity? The design checkoff (question 7) indicates we should be thinking about it, but is it a part of the rubric?
Thank you!
Answer: Your program as a whole should be very modular, with each logical step being its own function. Unit tests should be individually testing these functions (you can make the functions temporarily public). There may not be enough steps in main to need modularization, but main should have good abstraction. This means main shouldn't be handling the internal steps of your encoder class."
proj3,"Question: The spec mentions that there are 256 possible values of a char, but ASCII only accounts for 128 possible characters. I think I'm missing something - what are the other 128 characters? Thanks!
Answer: In C++, a char is represented using 8 bits, which means there are 2^8 == 256 possible values for a char. You are correct: ASCII only defines what characters the ints 0 through 127 correspond to. But, a C++ char can store more values outside of this range.
So the question is what do those extra values represent—well, at the end of the day they are just bits. If you were to try and print characters corresponding to values 128 through 255 using cout, then what you see will simply depend on what your terminal supports. Some terminals support what is called ""extended ASCII"", in which an additional 128 characters can be represented. Others will just print nonsense. Overall: yes, regular ASCII just supports 128 characters, but a C++ char can store additional values beyond this."
proj4,"Question: Should our deserialize_tree function be able to handle ""invalid"" inputs (e.g. a leaf with no corresponding character value or more than one leaf without a parent)? If so, should we throw a runtime_error? The spec discusses bad tree traversals, but doesn't directly address serialization (from what I have seen).
Thank you! 
Answer: We will not test for the case you mentioned."

I am trying to test my program with gerp_perf but I keep getting this message:

Make sure your program works properly by running it outside of gerp_perf.
My program works outside of gerp_perf. Does this mean that it's too slow?

proj4,"Question: Hello!

My partner and I created multiple testing directories for gerp.
Could you please let me know if we should submit them or only the files that they contained?

Thank you!
Answer: I don't believe Gradescope accepts directories. That being said, please only submit a few unique input and command/query files that test different edge cases. You shouldn't need to provide different files that test the same thing."
proj4,"Question: Does anyone know how many unique words are in smallGutenberg, mediumGutenberg, and largeGutenberg?

proj4,"Question: For example, when searching for “comp” and case insensitivity.

Will it match with 

Comp
cOmp 
coMp
comP

Or just
Comp
Answer: Just like Elias said, a case sensitive search of ""cOmp"" with your given lines would only match with the ""cOmp"" on line 2.
But an insensitive search of ""cOmp"" would match with every single line since they are all just different casings of the letters c-o-m-p."
proj4,"Question: Hello,
Our gerp has been failing a test called ""Tiny Insensitive Query Ending on EOF"". However, we are really not sure what it means. I'm wondering if any elaboration on what it means could be given. Is it testing reading to the end of all files, but still not able to find the word? 

Thank you!"
proj4,"Question: Since my partner and I have a few very short if statements that could be written on a single line, but the style guide states that we should not use single-line if statements, could we instead use ternary operators to reduce them to one-line if-else expressions?
Answer: Yes, ternary operators are fine."
proj4,"Question: Can we use the std::array STL implementation (instead of normal array)?
Answer: Sure, though it's not included on the list of STL libraries, this particular exception is fine."
proj4,"Question: Hi!!
We were wondering if any points will be taken off for grading if we have a struct or a certain function as public in our class. In addition, can we have a struct that only has public members?
Thank you!
Answer: We can't really say a definitive yes or no to this, because it can depend on what info is being made public/what the rest of the class is doing/what interacts with the public info. But generally, all past abstraction barrier expectations still apply to this project. So use those to make educated decisions about what the safest practice is for your implementation. You can also see past rubrics for how many points are lost for not adhering to abstraction barrier (i.e. having info that's public that should be private)."
proj4,"Question: Hi,
The spec says that we can use pairs from the utility library, but are we allowed to use other functions in that library, like move?
Thanks!
Answer: Sure, using the ""move"" function is fine, as long as you understand what it does and it makes sense to use for your program. Not everything from the utility library is allowed—in particular, you cannot use anything related to smart pointers."
proj4,"Question: Hi,
We wrote unit tests to test our index that run our gerp on the directories small_Gutenburg, medium_Gutenburg and large_Gutenburg. However, valgrind keeps acting very bizarre (It looks like memory corruption). Is this a flaw in our code or do you not recommend using the unit_test framework with the Gutenberg directories?
Thanks!
Answer: Using valgrind will slow down your program and make it less memory efficient. Because unit_test runs valgrind, I'd recommend only using unit_test with very small datasets, then separately testing the Gutenberg datasets without unit_test."
proj4,"Question: Is the c++ <algorithm> library available for our use? On a similar note, is it safe to assume the only banned c++ types/libraries for this project are the ones explicitly mentioned in the spec?
Answer: It really depends on which parts of the algorithm library you'd like to use. For example, using something basic like the ""max"" function is fine. But you should not use certain operations, e.g., search operations that use functionality we would expect you to implement yourself.
I don't believe the spec has a ""banned libraries"" list. For the STL library, you can only use the ones that are explicitly listed as allowed. If you're unsure about some other library, please ask here."
proj4,"Question: We were wondering if we need an open or die function for gerp —if we're using the file traverser, we know that all the files will exist (since it has a DirNode), so it seems unneccesary/redundant.
However, we wanted to check first if excluding it is allowed, and if we do need an open or die function, what sort of error should be thrown.
Answer: You never need an open or die function, but if you want to know how the provided code handles file read errors, you should try experimenting with it! You can use chmod to set read write and execute permissions on a file. For example, if you make a new file and then run the command: chmod 000 FILENAME it will remove all permissions, so that file will always fail to open for reading and writing. Then you can see if the code catches that successfully or not."
proj4,"Question: Are we allowed to #include <algorithm>? I just want to use the max function in one of my functions.
Answer: Yes, for the max function that is fine"
proj4,"Question: Hello! I've got the funkiest issue with LiveShare. Whenever I type code, it pops up on my partners screen as completely in reverse (like this: esrever ni yletelpmoc) and moves around lines numbers and puts some things in comments that I did not put in comments. Anybody know what this issue is..."
proj4,"Question: Our gerp runs really fast (within 5sec) while not running valgrind on the small gutenberg, but when we're using valgrind, it's like 20 secs (no memory leakage). I was wondering when autograder is testing it, would it do it seperately on testing speed and testing memory leakage.
Answer: The target runtime we'll check you for will be without running with valgrind. Valgrind implicitly makes any program run slower, so no worries about the longer runtime!"
proj4,"Question: We were looking for a way to store data and came up with this solution Is this allowed?
vector<vector<vector<string>>> wordData;

I'm not sure if we have covered this in class yet.
Answer: At the end of the day, this is just a vector. So yes, of course that's allowed."
proj4,"Question: I know we're not allowed to use <unordered_map> or <unordered_set>, but <set> is permitted, so I was wondering if <map> also is.
Answer: Yeah, no to std::map"
proj4,"Question: Can we use the auto keyword and range-based loop for Proj4?  I found it would be much easier and clearer to use those in code instead of the explicit iterator. I know we can use auto based on previous questions, like @443. But it would make the project trivial, so I am not sure whether we can do that. I just want to be sure. Many examples on: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/range-based-loop-c/
For example, some things like this. Copied for above website:
Answer: You are definitely allowed to use range-based for loops. If you do, I advise doing it with references where possible (as in the second and third examples you shared) because this would save a lot of time/space.
However, in accordance with our style guide, you should only use the ""auto"" keyword when declaring variables of an iterator type. That is not the case in the examples you've shared above—the variables you are declaring are of type int. So auto would not be allowed for the examples you shared."
proj4,Question: Are we limited to maintaining the current functions in Phase 1? Could I make phase 1 into a class or change the function arguments? Thank you.
proj4,"Question: I can't seem to find where the output of the traverseDirectory function is supposed to print. I'm assuming it is cout, but I wanted to make sure.

Answer: Yes, please print them to cout"
proj4,"Question: Hey folks,
We thought it might be fun to have a small competition for gerp submissions in terms of space/time performance on large Gutenberg. This is competition is totally optional. If you would like to compete, please upload your code files to the Gradescope assignment proj4_gerp_leaderboard – it should be the same files you provide to proj4_gerp.
As part of the uploading process, you will be able to choose a name for your group’s submission on the leaderboard. Once the submission has run through a few tests, you can see your position on the leaderboard by clicking on the ""Leaderboard"" tab in the top right of your submission. Note that there are a few correctness tests to ensure your results aren’t completely hacked - these correctness tests aren’t as thorough as the ‘normal’ ones, but if you fail any of them, you will not be placed on the leaderboard. We also reserve the right to inspect and remove any submissions that we deem fishy—so no funny business.
We won’t release the formula for calculating the score exactly, but notice that the reference scores ~1.0. The reference solution is already posted, see if you can beat it!
On the leaderboard page, you will be able to rank submissions based on RAM usage, index time, query time, or total score so you can see how your solution does in various categories. However, the winner will be selected based on the best (lowest) total score. The prize for the winning pair will be the Golden Duck Award (attached below).
You can submit to the leaderboard essentially as many times as you'd like (you're capped at 100). We will close submissions on Friday April 25 at 11:59pm — the same as the two token deadline (but you will not be charged tokens for the leaderboard).
Lastly, again, this is completely optional. Have fun!
Cheers,
Milod"
proj4,"Question: Hi! I was just wondering if we’re allowed to add a helper function for traverseDirectory to implement a recursive solution? Thanks!
Answer: Yes absolutely, you may do that.
(Making this public so others can benefit)."
proj4,"Question: The spec says we should not do it with vectors, but not lists so I was wondering if we could with lists?
Answer: (By list, I’m assuming you mean Linked List). Using a list is likely to give you other problems, primarily non-constant time lookup for elements in the middle of the list.
The reason we tell you not to use pointers with vectors is that vectors can expand themselves with an under-the-hood implementation that is hidden from you, the user. Normally it’s nice not to have to worry about that implementation detail, but for this specific use case, it’s important to be very aware of when the array being used to implement the vector gets reallocated.
Think about why that is the case. Why is it necessary to control the array expansion? How could you achieve this without using an std::vector?
Liam"
proj4,"Question: How do we go about creating test directories for traverseDirectory to test in the unit_test framework? If we create some new folders in the same directory we have the unit_tests.h file, shouldn't we just be able to pass the name of those folders to the traverseDirectory function in the unit_tests.h file? However, if we do this traverseDirectory cannot find the folders, which we thought would be handled by FSTree."
proj4,"Question: My partner and I were wondering what stripNonAlphanumeric returns when it's passed a string of just non-alphanumeric chars, for example, ""!#@""
Does it just return an empty string? Should it throw an error? There is no mention of this in the spec, to my knowledge.
Answer: Since stripNonAlphanumeric removes the trailing and leading non-alphanumeric characters, it should return the empty string in this case."
proj4,"Question: To me more specific, should we expect to see strings that are fully non-alphanumeric and can't be parsed to a Word?"
proj4,Question: Do both my partner and I have to submit the design checkoff on gradescope?
proj4,"Question: Hypothetically, if there was a file with over 100 z's, would that be considered a word or would we say the file does not include any words?
Answer: I'm a little unclear what exactly you mean, but any orientation of 100 z's in a file is one or more words.
A single string containing 100 z's and nothing else -- is a word of length 100
100 z's separated by some whitespace/newlines -- is 100 words that are all just ""z""
Any combo of the above two cases -- is at least one word
""Words"" in this case are just any formation of alphanumeric symbols. They don't have to be legit words that are in the dictionary (""laskdjflksdjf"" is just as much a word as ""pants"")."
proj4,"Question: Hello! My gerp partner and I have been repeatedly trying to get a live share session started up, but it is not working for us. When one of us starts a session, the other clicks the invite link and appears to join the workspace, but then the page is just continually loading and they can't actually see the host's content. Do you know why this would be happening and what we can do to fix it?"
proj4,"Question: Hi,
For the strip characters function, should special characters be removed from the middle? For example: 
Should comp&!$15 be returned as comp&!$15 or comp15? 
Thank you!
Answer: stripNonAlphaNum only removes the leading and trailing non-alphanumeric characters. So, since comp&!$15 starts and ends with alphanumeric characters, the function would return comp&!$15"
proj4,"Question: We are not allowed to use unordered map, what about unordred set? in the spec it only says set is okay, im not 100% sure.
Answer: That is intentional—you may use set but not unordered set."
proj4,"Question: Are we allowed to use std::hash for project 4 since its mentioned in helpful tips but not in the stl usage part of the spec?
Answer: I’m going to make this public because this is a question that others may have.
std::hash is not a hash table implementation, but rather used as a has function. std::hash is in the functional library, which is one of the reasons we allow that library. Let us know if you have any other questions."
proj4,"Question: From spec for grep: the option I means to search all files, including binary files
But what I found is
-I Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.
which is to simply skip binary files I think
is that a mistake?
Answer: Take a look at the documentation for grep: https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/grep1.html
-i is for case insensitive search. It looks like you are talking about the -a flag."
proj4,"Question: Hey! Me and my partner are trying to set up Live Share and are running into some issues I wonder if anyone could perhaps fix so we don't have to go to office hours. We both have Live Share downloaded, installed, and signed into. When my partner sends me the link, it opens in my browser and then I open it in VSCode and it says I have logged in and I'm in the collaboration session. However, on my partner's computer, she is not receiving a notification to approve me to join or otherwise being aware that there is another participant in her session. Does anyone have any tips?"
proj4,"Question: Does a case sensitive query of a word include special characters (i.e. is Good_Word! the same as GoodWord)? The definition of a case insensitive query is clear (all lowercase and stripped of any special characters other than numbers) but just not sure about case sensitive words.
Answer: I'm not sure I understand your question, but after stripping the leading and trailing alphanumeric characters, Good_Word and GoodWord are different words for both case sensitive and insensitive.
For case sensitive queries, GoodWord and goodword are different. For case insensitive queries GoodWord, goodword, GOODWORD, etc. are the same."
proj4,"Question: Will there be any words that are in all caps or contain more than one capital letter? Or is it safe to assume that capitals will only appear once and at the start of the word (e.g. an author's name or a book title)?
Answer: There certainly can/will be words where not just the first letter is upper-cased. Your implementation should be able to handle this."

proj4,"Question: For gerp can the program read all the queries at once and then answer them all or does it need to answer the first query before it gets the second?
Answer: You should not do this—you should respond to queries as they come in."
proj4,"Question: IMPORTANT: Please make sure only one person submits Gerp each time and then adds their partner to it!

As you all get ready to start Gerp, we wanted to share with you a guide on pair programming. Pair programming is a highly valuable skill that pops up in later CS courses here at Tufts as well as in many programming jobs (even interviews). That said, it doesn’t often get taught explicitly, so we want to share this guide with you. It details some best practices and styles, as well as some anti-patterns (things that seem like they would be helpful but aren’t) to watch out for as you work.

Tuple's Pair Programming

Tools and tricks
VS Code LiveShare. This is a great tool for pair programming, whether you partner virtually or not. Many pairing guides advise having one keyboard per person (everyone’s more comfortable on their own, even if you both use the same model). This allows for that and takes it a step further: you can each view the code with your own preferred themes and fonts.
One caveat: with liveshare, it’s very easy to fall out of pair programming and into a divide & conquer workflow. 
Divide & Conquer programming is not pair programming. A good litmus test is, if both partners are typing at the same time and code is being produced, they are dividing & conquering instead of pairing.

LiveShare has features that can help with this called focus and follow. These allow a navigator to “pin” their screen to whatever the current driver is editing. We highly recommend using these features most of the time as you start pairing.

Best of luck!

lab,"Question: Hello!
Instructions for setting up VS Code mention ""If you have already set up the SFTP extension to sync the entire contents of your Halligan account, you do not need to do anything.""

I took cs11 last semester, and I am not completely sure if I synced entire account's contents or only the cs11 folder.

Would it be appropriate to complete the vscode_setup guide anyway?

Thank you! 
Answer: I personally like to setup an SFTP for each class, that way I just need to have that class's folder open in VSCode rather than every single class in order to have access to the SFTP syncing. So yes, you can proceed with setting up the SFTP syncing like the instructions say, just make sure you're doing it while in your cs15 folder in VSCode. Follow up if you have any other questions about getting it set up!
You can also open up your old cs11 folder in VSCode and take a look at what you did for SFTP if you're curious."

Answer: Ah, that's a good point :).
I haven't added students to the gradescope yet, as we still have many students adding/dropping the course. I'll do this at some point within the next few days.
With that said, lab 0 is entirely optional, and you receive no credit for doing it. So whether you ultimately submit it or not will have no effect."
