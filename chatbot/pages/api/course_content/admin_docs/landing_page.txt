CS 15 - Summer 2025

Welcome to CS 15! CS 15 is all about building your programming toolkit. The tools are data structures, the means by which we store, organize, and access data. We will implement and utilize the key data structures and algorithms that every programmer must know, learn about the useful abstractions that they provide, and study the costs in time and space associated with them. The structure and assignments of this course are based largely on prior versions of the course taught by Marty Allen, Milod Kazerounian, Mark Sheldon, Mati Korman, Chris Gregg, Ben Hescott, and Bruce Molay. Thank you!
