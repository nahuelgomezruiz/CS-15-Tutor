        #1 The following document is about a project assignment for creating a text compression and decompression program using the Huffman coding algorithm.
        
            #1.1 The following is about the introduction to the compression process, explaining its significance in data representation and the purpose of the zap program.:
<begin>
Introduction

Compression is the process of reducing the number of bits needed to represent some data. We rely on
it all the time: when we stream music and movies, talk to someone on Zoom, or even access a web
page. It’s likely that you’ve compressed data before into a .zip file — maybe to send that data to
someone via email, or maybe just to save some space on your hard drive.

For this assignment, you will be writing your own compression program called zap! Your pro-
gram will specifically be used for compressing and decompressing text files using the Huffman coding
algorithm.

<end>
            
            #1.2 The following is about how to run the zap program, detailing the commands for compressing and decompressing files using the Huffman coding algorithm.:
<begin>
Running zap

zap can be run in just two ways: you can zap (compress) a file, or unzap (decompress) a file. To zap,
from the command line run:

./zap zap inputFile outputFile

This will take the ASCII text file named inputFile, compress it using the Huffman coding algo-
rithm, and store the result in a file named outputFile. It will also print to cout a message that looks
as follows:

Success! Encoded given text using N bits.

where N is the size in bits of the encoded text.

To unzap, simply run:

./zap unzap inputFile outputFile

This will take the previously zapped file inputFile, decompress it, and store the resulting ASCII

text in outputFile. It will not print anything to cout.

And that’s it! There are no other ways to run zap, and unlike previous assignments, there is no

command loop for this program.

An unzapped file’s contents should be identical to the originally zapped file, e.g., if you run

./zap zap shakespeare.txt shake.zap
./zap unzap shake.zap new_shakespeare.txt

then the files shakespeare.txt and new_shakespeare.txt should be identical — you can use diff
to confirm this.

<end>
            
            #1.3 The following is about reading a zap file, explaining how to retrieve the serialized tree and encoded binary string using the readZapFile function.:
<begin>
Reading the zap file

You should once again use the provided ZapUtil files, this time to read from a previously saved binary
file. Simply call the readZapFile function, providing the filename to read from. This function will
return a pair<string, string>, containing both the serialized tree and the binary string encoding.
A pair is a special C++ data structure from the <utility> library that stores just two elements.
You will need to include <utility> if you declare any pair variables. To access the elements of a
pair, use the member variables .first and .second. Take a look at the C++ documentation for
pair for more information: https://cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/pair/.

<end>
            
            #1.4 The following is about the reference implementation provided to assist in implementing and testing the Huffman coding program.:
<begin>
Reference Implementation and Testing

To assist you with implementing and testing your program, we have provided you with the_zap, a
compiled reference implementation. You should play around with this implementation to get a feel
for how it works, and use it to test your own implementation once it is built.

<end>
            
            #1.5 The following is about the usage instructions for the command line arguments for the zap program, which is part of the text compression and decompression project.:
<begin>
of command line arguments or by
providing a first argument other than “zap” or “unzap”, then zap will print the following usage message
to cerr:

Usage: ./zap [zap | unzap] inputFile outputFile

then return EXIT_FAILURE.

2

If you provide the name of an input file that cannot be opened, then your encoder function, or

one of its helpers, should throw a runtime_error with the error message:
Unable to open file FILENAME
where FILENAME is the invalid input file name, and the error message does not end with a newline.
The encoder function is described in detail below. If a user specifies an incorrect file in an invalid
command, the invalid command error takes precedence.

<end>
            
            #1.6 The following is about testing the implementation by ensuring that zap files created by the program can be unzipped correctly by the reference implementation.:
<begin>
There are other ways to test your program as well. For example, any zap file created by your
implementation should be unzap-able by the reference implementation, and vice versa. Try it out:
zap a file with your implementation, and unzap with the reference. Is the resulting text the same as
the original? If not, something has gone wrong.

You can also test your own implementation’s encoder against its decoder, for example:

./zap zap A.txt B.zap
./zap unzap B.zap C.txt
diff A.txt C.txt

Calling diff above should result in no output—A.txt and C.txt should contain identical contents.

If they don’t, you have some debugging to do.

Review: Phases of Program Translation

You learned in CS 11 that C++ programs cannot run in their text form. You
need to translate the C++ source code, written in plain text, into the binary
representation of the particular computer’s instructions.

This translation takes place in a series of stages. Once you start to
write programs that have multiple modules (components/classes, stored in
different files in C++) you must be aware of two phases: compilation and
linking.

implementation. The functions have been left blank intentionally, except for
the toString() function, which is only partially implemented. It is your
task to complete and test these functions using the given unit_tests.h file.
Now, open the unit_tests.h file. Here you will find a few tests imple-
mented for you. However, the ArrayList.cpp code is not implemented, so
at least one of the tests will fail at first!

Program structure

Your program should include at least the following files:

• HuffmanCoder.h and HuffmanCoder.cpp. These files respectively define the interface and im-
plementation of the HuffmanCoder class, which comprises the main logic of the Huffman coding
algorithm. The class should have the following two public functions:

void encoder(const std::string &input_file, const std::string &output_file)

encoder takes a text file named input_file, compresses its text, and stores the result in a file
named output_file.

void decoder(const std::string &input_file, const std::string &output_file)

decoder takes a zapped file named input_file, decompresses it, and stores the resulting text
in a file named output_file.

You can optionally add a public constructor and destructor to the HuffmanCoder class, but you
are not required to do so. Any other functions that you add to this class must be private.

• main.cpp. This file includes your main function. It should process the command line arguments
(ensuring they are valid), and appropriately call either the encoder or decoder function of the
HuffmanCoder class.

• HuffmanTreeNode.h, ZapUtil.h, and their corresponding .o files: these files are provided by

us, and will be discussed in greater detail later in the spec.

what is zap?,"The following is additional context that may be helpful in answering the user's query.
        #1 The following document is about a project assignment for creating a text compression and decompression program using the Huffman coding algorithm.
        
            #1.1 The following is about the introduction to the compression process, explaining its significance in data representation and the purpose of the zap program.:
<begin>
Introduction

Compression is the process of reducing the number of bits needed to represent some data. We rely on
it all the time: when we stream music and movies, talk to someone on Zoom, or even access a web
page. It’s likely that you’ve compressed data before into a .zip file — maybe to send that data to
someone via email, or maybe just to save some space on your hard drive.

For this assignment, you will be writing your own compression program called zap! Your pro-
gram will specifically be used for compressing and decompressing text files using the Huffman coding
algorithm.

<end>
            
            #1.2 The following is about how to run the zap program, detailing the commands for compressing and decompressing files using the Huffman coding algorithm.:
<begin>
Running zap

zap can be run in just two ways: you can zap (compress) a file, or unzap (decompress) a file. To zap,
from the command line run:

./zap zap inputFile outputFile

This will take the ASCII text file named inputFile, compress it using the Huffman coding algo-
rithm, and store the result in a file named outputFile. It will also print to cout a message that looks
as follows:

Success! Encoded given text using N bits.

where N is the size in bits of the encoded text.

To unzap, simply run:

./zap unzap inputFile outputFile

This will take the previously zapped file inputFile, decompress it, and store the resulting ASCII

text in outputFile. It will not print anything to cout.

And that’s it! There are no other ways to run zap, and unlike previous assignments, there is no

command loop for this program.

An unzapped file’s contents should be identical to the originally zapped file, e.g., if you run

./zap zap shakespeare.txt shake.zap
./zap unzap shake.zap new_shakespeare.txt

then the files shakespeare.txt and new_shakespeare.txt should be identical — you can use diff
to confirm this.

<end>
            
            #1.3 The following is about reading a zap file, explaining how to retrieve the serialized tree and encoded binary string using the readZapFile function.:
<begin>
Reading the zap file

You should once again use the provided ZapUtil files, this time to read from a previously saved binary
file. Simply call the readZapFile function, providing the filename to read from. This function will
return a pair<string, string>, containing both the serialized tree and the binary string encoding.
A pair is a special C++ data structure from the <utility> library that stores just two elements.
You will need to include <utility> if you declare any pair variables. To access the elements of a
pair, use the member variables .first and .second. Take a look at the C++ documentation for
pair for more information: https://cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/pair/.

<end>
            
            #1.4 The following is about the reference implementation provided to assist in implementing and testing the Huffman coding program.:
<begin>
Reference Implementation and Testing

To assist you with implementing and testing your program, we have provided you with the_zap, a
compiled reference implementation. You should play around with this implementation to get a feel
for how it works, and use it to test your own implementation once it is built.

<end>
            
            #1.5 The following is about the usage instructions for the command line arguments for the zap program, which is part of the text compression and decompression project.:
<begin>
of command line arguments or by
providing a first argument other than “zap” or “unzap”, then zap will print the following usage message
to cerr:

Usage: ./zap [zap | unzap] inputFile outputFile

then return EXIT_FAILURE.

2

If you provide the name of an input file that cannot be opened, then your encoder function, or

one of its helpers, should throw a runtime_error with the error message:
Unable to open file FILENAME
where FILENAME is the invalid input file name, and the error message does not end with a newline.
The encoder function is described in detail below. If a user specifies an incorrect file in an invalid
command, the invalid command error takes precedence.

<end>
            ",Zap is a program you will create in CS 15 for compressing and decompressing text files using the Huffman coding algorithm. It allows you to reduce the size of text data and retrieve the original content accurately.

Introduction

Professor Evil is hijacking a class and wants your help to fail all the students!
That way, their class will look much better in comparison. They are so
enthusiastic that they have done all the coding already. You only need to
make a Makefile for the evil plan to succeed!

Review: Phases of Program Translation

You learned in CS 11 that C++ programs cannot run in their text form. You
need to translate the C++ source code, written in plain text, into the binary
representation of the particular computer’s instructions.

This translation takes place in a series of stages. Once you start to
write programs that have multiple modules (components/classes, stored in
different files in C++) you must be aware of two phases: compilation and
linking.

            #4.1 The following is about the lab tasks, encouraging students to write functions and tests, and suggesting a focus on either stack or queue implementations first.:
<begin>
The Lab

There are bunch of functions for you to write! Work through as many as
you can in lab. You might want to skip CircularBuffer::expand() at first
- we suggest getting either the stack or queue working, and then come back
to expand.

Also, it would to your advantage to write tests as you’re writing your

functions! Lab is a good opportunity to begin developing this habit!

<end>
            
            #4.2 The following is about tasks for implementing Stack and Queue methods, detailing the required push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue functions.:
<begin>
Tasks for Stack and Queue

Once you have written the circular buffer methods, it should be easy to
implement the following methods in the Stack and Queue classes.

1. Write the

void Stack::push(ElementType element) method and test it.

2. Write the ElementType Stack::pop() method and test it.

3. Write the

void Queue::enqueue(ElementType element) method and test it.

4. Write the ElementType Queue::dequeue() method and test it.

Tips

• front and back are integers. They are keeping track of the indices of

the front and back of the list within the current array.

• Keep careful track of where front and back are in the array. If front
is 0, and then you add an element to the front of the circular array,
what should front be next?

• Make sure you test each function right after you write it!

You are encouraged to discuss test strategies with other students and with
the course staff. Recall the previous lab in which we went over incremental
development and debugging output, and use these strategies as you write
your functions.
