        #1 The following document is about a project assignment for creating a text compression and decompression program using the Huffman coding algorithm.
        
            #1.1 The following is about the introduction to the compression process, explaining its significance in data representation and the purpose of the zap program.:
<begin>
Introduction

Compression is the process of reducing the number of bits needed to represent some data. We rely on
it all the time: when we stream music and movies, talk to someone on Zoom, or even access a web
page. It’s likely that you’ve compressed data before into a .zip file — maybe to send that data to
someone via email, or maybe just to save some space on your hard drive.

For this assignment, you will be writing your own compression program called zap! Your pro-
gram will specifically be used for compressing and decompressing text files using the Huffman coding
algorithm.

<end>
            
            #1.2 The following is about how to run the zap program, detailing the commands for compressing and decompressing files using the Huffman coding algorithm.:
<begin>
Running zap

zap can be run in just two ways: you can zap (compress) a file, or unzap (decompress) a file. To zap,
from the command line run:

./zap zap inputFile outputFile

This will take the ASCII text file named inputFile, compress it using the Huffman coding algo-
rithm, and store the result in a file named outputFile. It will also print to cout a message that looks
as follows:

Success! Encoded given text using N bits.

where N is the size in bits of the encoded text.

To unzap, simply run:

./zap unzap inputFile outputFile

This will take the previously zapped file inputFile, decompress it, and store the resulting ASCII

text in outputFile. It will not print anything to cout.

And that’s it! There are no other ways to run zap, and unlike previous assignments, there is no

command loop for this program.

An unzapped file’s contents should be identical to the originally zapped file, e.g., if you run

./zap zap shakespeare.txt shake.zap
./zap unzap shake.zap new_shakespeare.txt

then the files shakespeare.txt and new_shakespeare.txt should be identical — you can use diff
to confirm this.

<end>
            
            #1.3 The following is about reading a zap file, explaining how to retrieve the serialized tree and encoded binary string using the readZapFile function.:
<begin>
Reading the zap file

You should once again use the provided ZapUtil files, this time to read from a previously saved binary
file. Simply call the readZapFile function, providing the filename to read from. This function will
return a pair<string, string>, containing both the serialized tree and the binary string encoding.
A pair is a special C++ data structure from the <utility> library that stores just two elements.
You will need to include <utility> if you declare any pair variables. To access the elements of a
pair, use the member variables .first and .second. Take a look at the C++ documentation for
pair for more information: https://cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/pair/.

<end>
            
            #1.4 The following is about the reference implementation provided to assist in implementing and testing the Huffman coding program.:
<begin>
Reference Implementation and Testing

To assist you with implementing and testing your program, we have provided you with the_zap, a
compiled reference implementation. You should play around with this implementation to get a feel
for how it works, and use it to test your own implementation once it is built.

<end>
            
            #1.5 The following is about the usage instructions for the command line arguments for the zap program, which is part of the text compression and decompression project.:
<begin>
of command line arguments or by
providing a first argument other than “zap” or “unzap”, then zap will print the following usage message
to cerr:

Usage: ./zap [zap | unzap] inputFile outputFile

then return EXIT_FAILURE.

2

If you provide the name of an input file that cannot be opened, then your encoder function, or

one of its helpers, should throw a runtime_error with the error message:
Unable to open file FILENAME
where FILENAME is the invalid input file name, and the error message does not end with a newline.
The encoder function is described in detail below. If a user specifies an incorrect file in an invalid
command, the invalid command error takes precedence.

<end>
            
            #1.6 The following is about testing the implementation by ensuring that zap files created by the program can be unzipped correctly by the reference implementation.:
<begin>
There are other ways to test your program as well. For example, any zap file created by your
implementation should be unzap-able by the reference implementation, and vice versa. Try it out:
zap a file with your implementation, and unzap with the reference. Is the resulting text the same as
the original? If not, something has gone wrong.

You can also test your own implementation’s encoder against its decoder, for example:

./zap zap A.txt B.zap
./zap unzap B.zap C.txt
diff A.txt C.txt

Calling diff above should result in no output—A.txt and C.txt should contain identical contents.

If they don’t, you have some debugging to do.

Review: Phases of Program Translation

You learned in CS 11 that C++ programs cannot run in their text form. You
need to translate the C++ source code, written in plain text, into the binary
representation of the particular computer’s instructions.

This translation takes place in a series of stages. Once you start to
write programs that have multiple modules (components/classes, stored in
different files in C++) you must be aware of two phases: compilation and
linking.

implementation. The functions have been left blank intentionally, except for
the toString() function, which is only partially implemented. It is your
task to complete and test these functions using the given unit_tests.h file.
Now, open the unit_tests.h file. Here you will find a few tests imple-
mented for you. However, the ArrayList.cpp code is not implemented, so

• HuffmanCoder.h and HuffmanCoder.cpp. These files respectively define the interface and im-

algorithm. The class should have the following two public functions:

void encoder(const std::string &input_file, const std::string &output_file)

encoder takes a text file named input_file, compresses its text, and stores the result in a file
named output_file.

void decoder(const std::string &input_file, const std::string &output_file)

decoder takes a zapped file named input_file, decompresses it, and stores the resulting text
in a file named output_file.

You can optionally add a public constructor and destructor to the HuffmanCoder class, but you
are not required to do so. Any other functions that you add to this class must be private.

• main.cpp. This file includes your main function. It should process the command line arguments
(ensuring they are valid), and appropriately call either the encoder or decoder function of the
HuffmanCoder class.

• HuffmanTreeNode.h, ZapUtil.h, and their corresponding .o files: these files are provided by

CharLinkedList class. The class definition will go in a file named CharLinkedList.h, and the class
implementation will go in a file named CharLinkedList.cpp. We’ll describe the interface first, then
give some implementation specifics, ask you some questions, and finally give submission instructions.
Don’t forget to answer the questions in your README!

what is zap?,"The following is additional context that may be helpful in answering the user's query.
        #1 The following document is about a project assignment for creating a text compression and decompression program using the Huffman coding algorithm.
        
            #1.1 The following is about the introduction to the compression process, explaining its significance in data representation and the purpose of the zap program.:
<begin>
Introduction

Compression is the process of reducing the number of bits needed to represent some data. We rely on
it all the time: when we stream music and movies, talk to someone on Zoom, or even access a web
page. It’s likely that you’ve compressed data before into a .zip file — maybe to send that data to
someone via email, or maybe just to save some space on your hard drive.

For this assignment, you will be writing your own compression program called zap! Your pro-
gram will specifically be used for compressing and decompressing text files using the Huffman coding
algorithm.

<end>
            
            #1.2 The following is about how to run the zap program, detailing the commands for compressing and decompressing files using the Huffman coding algorithm.:
<begin>
Running zap

zap can be run in just two ways: you can zap (compress) a file, or unzap (decompress) a file. To zap,
from the command line run:

./zap zap inputFile outputFile

This will take the ASCII text file named inputFile, compress it using the Huffman coding algo-
rithm, and store the result in a file named outputFile. It will also print to cout a message that looks
as follows:

Success! Encoded given text using N bits.

where N is the size in bits of the encoded text.

To unzap, simply run:

./zap unzap inputFile outputFile

This will take the previously zapped file inputFile, decompress it, and store the resulting ASCII

text in outputFile. It will not print anything to cout.

And that’s it! There are no other ways to run zap, and unlike previous assignments, there is no

command loop for this program.

An unzapped file’s contents should be identical to the originally zapped file, e.g., if you run

./zap zap shakespeare.txt shake.zap
./zap unzap shake.zap new_shakespeare.txt

then the files shakespeare.txt and new_shakespeare.txt should be identical — you can use diff
to confirm this.

<end>
            
            #1.3 The following is about reading a zap file, explaining how to retrieve the serialized tree and encoded binary string using the readZapFile function.:
<begin>
Reading the zap file

You should once again use the provided ZapUtil files, this time to read from a previously saved binary
file. Simply call the readZapFile function, providing the filename to read from. This function will
return a pair<string, string>, containing both the serialized tree and the binary string encoding.
A pair is a special C++ data structure from the <utility> library that stores just two elements.
You will need to include <utility> if you declare any pair variables. To access the elements of a
pair, use the member variables .first and .second. Take a look at the C++ documentation for
pair for more information: https://cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/pair/.

<end>
            
            #1.4 The following is about the reference implementation provided to assist in implementing and testing the Huffman coding program.:
<begin>
Reference Implementation and Testing

To assist you with implementing and testing your program, we have provided you with the_zap, a
compiled reference implementation. You should play around with this implementation to get a feel
for how it works, and use it to test your own implementation once it is built.

<end>
            
            #1.5 The following is about the usage instructions for the command line arguments for the zap program, which is part of the text compression and decompression project.:
<begin>
of command line arguments or by
providing a first argument other than “zap” or “unzap”, then zap will print the following usage message
to cerr:

Usage: ./zap [zap | unzap] inputFile outputFile

then return EXIT_FAILURE.

2

If you provide the name of an input file that cannot be opened, then your encoder function, or

one of its helpers, should throw a runtime_error with the error message:
Unable to open file FILENAME
where FILENAME is the invalid input file name, and the error message does not end with a newline.
The encoder function is described in detail below. If a user specifies an incorrect file in an invalid
command, the invalid command error takes precedence.

<end>
            ",Zap is a program you will create in CS 15 for compressing and decompressing text files using the Huffman coding algorithm. It allows you to reduce the size of text data and retrieve the original content accurately.

Introduction

Professor Evil is hijacking a class and wants your help to fail all the students!
That way, their class will look much better in comparison. They are so
enthusiastic that they have done all the coding already. You only need to
make a Makefile for the evil plan to succeed!

Review: Phases of Program Translation

You learned in CS 11 that C++ programs cannot run in their text form. You
need to translate the C++ source code, written in plain text, into the binary
representation of the particular computer’s instructions.

This translation takes place in a series of stages. Once you start to
write programs that have multiple modules (components/classes, stored in
different files in C++) you must be aware of two phases: compilation and
linking.

<begin>
The Lab

There are bunch of functions for you to write! Work through as many as
you can in lab. You might want to skip CircularBuffer::expand() at first
- we suggest getting either the stack or queue working, and then come back
to expand.

Also, it would to your advantage to write tests as you’re writing your

functions! Lab is a good opportunity to begin developing this habit!

<end>
            
            #4.2 The following is about tasks for implementing Stack and Queue methods, detailing the required push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue functions.:
<begin>
Tasks for Stack and Queue

Once you have written the circular buffer methods, it should be easy to
implement the following methods in the Stack and Queue classes.

1. Write the

void Stack::push(ElementType element) method and test it.

2. Write the ElementType Stack::pop() method and test it.

3. Write the

void Queue::enqueue(ElementType element) method and test it.

4. Write the ElementType Queue::dequeue() method and test it.

Tips

• front and back are integers. They are keeping track of the indices of

the front and back of the list within the current array.

• Keep careful track of where front and back are in the array. If front
is 0, and then you add an element to the front of the circular array,
what should front be next?

• Make sure you test each function right after you write it!

You are encouraged to discuss test strategies with other students and with
the course staff. Recall the previous lab in which we went over incremental
development and debugging output, and use these strategies as you write
your functions.

expected of your program and to test your your program. We will be comparing your program’s
output to the reference, so be sure that you are adhering to the output format. If the diff command
reports any differences between the output of your implementation and the reference implementation,
then you will lose points on the functional correctness portion of your implementation assessment.

The Reference Implementation

After running the above command, you will have access to a reference implementation of the program

expected of your program and to test your your program. We will be comparing your program’s
output to the reference, so be sure that you are adhering to the output format. If the diff command
reports any differences between the output of your implementation and the reference implementation,

answers you submitted. You are welcome to bring other materials as well, though you are not required
to: drawings, pseudocode, etc.

The design checkoff helps twofold: you plan out your project and get your brain working on it in the
background, and you also get design feedback before it’s too late. TAs will check off your design, but
reserve the right to not check off your design if they believe your design was not thoroughly mapped
out enough.

Initialization

In the initialization phase you will open the stationsFile and process any Stations you find. The
stationsFile is in plain text, with one Station name per line. You may assume the stationsFile
has at least two Stations, and each Station’s name is a string of at least one character. Station
names may be more than one word, e. g., “South Station”.

Note: do not worry about malformed files. We will not test your program with empty Station
files or files with duplicate Station names, etc. Just program assuming any input files are correctly
formatted. You do, however, have to handle cases in which a file cannot be opened (see below for the
specific message and behavior).

After you have finished processing the stationsFile, print the Stations you have just read
(output specifications are below). Remember to place the Train at the first Station. Initially, there
are no Passengers in the Train or at any Station.

<begin>
Functions to Implement

You will write three functions, each implementing one of the traversals.

1. void BTree::inOrder(BTNode *curr, std::ostream &out) const

You must use recursion for this function, following the rules for print-
ing the nodes in the In-Order Algorithm section of this document.
(Make sure you use spaces appropriately when you print — you want
your solution to be the same as the solution that we provide).

2. void BTree::preOrder(BTNode *curr, std::ostream &out) const

Do a preorder traversal of the tree using an std::stack, following the
rules for printing the nodes in the Pre-Order Algorithm section of
this document, using the std::stack interface above.

3. void BTree::levelOrder(BTNode *curr, std::ostream &out) const

Do a level-order traversal of the tree using an std::queue, follow-
ing the rules for printing the nodes in the Level-Order Algorithm
section of this document, using the std::queue interface above.

4. Just For Fun Exercise (JFFE): void BTree::postOrderDelete(BTNode *curr)

Called by the destructor and should delete all nodes in a postorder
fashion. Exam-type question: Can we delete in another order, say by
doing a pre-order traversal?

Things to Notice

There are a few unusual things worth noticing in the code.

• Although the three functions above are private, there are also three

public functions that are defined as:

◦ void BTree::inOrder(std::ostream &out);
◦ void BTree::preOrder(std::ostream &out);
◦ void BTree::levelOrder(std::ostream &out);
◦ void BTree::postOrderDelete(std::ostream &out);

These functions are the ones called in the testing functions in main.cpp.
They will then call their corresponding private version. These are

        #4 The following document is about an introductory lab for a computer science course that focuses on unit testing and creating a simplified ArrayList class, including guidelines on writing effective tests and handling edge cases.
        
            #4.1 The following is about familiarizing with the ArrayList class and its implementation details.:
<begin>
Introduction

Start by familiarizing yourself with the ArrayList.h file. You will see a very
simple interface for an ArrayList class with a few functions defined for you.
Notice also that the data type that the ArrayList holds is an integer.

Next, open the ArrayList.cpp file. Inside you will find an incomplete
implementation. The functions have been left blank intentionally, except for
the toString() function, which is only partially implemented. It is your
task to complete and test these functions using the given unit_tests.h file.
Now, open the unit_tests.h file. Here you will find a few tests imple-
mented for you. However, the ArrayList.cpp code is not implemented, so
at least one of the tests will fail at first!

<end>
            
            #4.2 The following is about the specific tasks to be completed for the lab, including modifications to ArrayList.h and ArrayList.cpp.:
<begin>
To-Do Items

Your tasks are:

1. Add any necessary elements to ArrayList.h (see the TODO in the

private section there).

2. Implement each of the unimplemented functions in ArrayList.cpp

3. After you write each function in ArrayList.cpp, think of and write

at least one test function for it in unit_tests.h.

4. Whenever you’re ready to run a test, just run the command unit_test
in your terminal. Your code will be compiled, tests will run, and the
output will show you the results.

5. Fill in the missing sections of the README provided for you.

            #5.1 The following is about the implementation details for the DatumStack and RPNCalc classes, emphasizing the need to adhere to specific function signatures and data encapsulation for the RPN calculator project.:
<begin>
Implementation Notes and Advice

You will write both the DatumStack and RPNCalc classes from scratch. They will each have two
ﬁles associated with them - a .h ﬁle and a .cpp ﬁle. In addition to the public interfaces for the
class deﬁned above, you are free to add any private member functions / variables that you wish.

14

CONTENTS

15

• The names of your functions / methods as well as the order
and types of parameters and return types of the interface of
the DatumStack and RPNCalc classes and the parseRString
functions deﬁned above must be exactly as speciﬁed. This is
important because we will be compiling and linking the code
you wrote with our own client code!

• Any print statements or exception messages should likewise

print exactly as speciﬁed and use the given error type.

• For the two classes, you may not have any other public func-

tions.

• All data members must be private.

• You may not use std::stack or any other built-in facility that

would render the assignment trivial.

        #6 The following document is about implementing and testing functions for stacks, queues, and circular buffers in a computer science lab.
        
            #6.1 The following is about tasks for implementing the Circular Buffer, including writing helper functions and methods for adding and removing elements.:
<begin>
Tasks for Cicular Buffer

1. Write the int CircularBuffer::nextIndex helper function that,

given an index in the buffer, returns the next index. Remember to
wrap around to the start of the array when you get to the end! (Why
do we have this function?) Hint: You may find it useful to implement a
similar private helper function that returns the previous index. Think
about which functions below might benefit from a prevIndex function.

2. Write the void CircularBuffer::expand() method and test it. This
should correctly expand the circular array. Pay special attention to
wrapping. This function will be different than other expands you have
written!

3. Write the void CircularBuffer::addAtFront(ElementType elem)
method and test it. This should add the given elem to the “front” of
the sequence. Note: This should not shift elements!

4. Write the

ElementType CircularBuffer::removeFromBack() method and test
it. This should remove the last element in the sequence.

5

5. Write ElementType CircularBuffer::removeFromFront() method
and test it. This should remove the first element in the sequence.

You are welcome to add additional private methods to the

CircularBuffer class, if you wish.

Note!

A function to add an element to the back of the array has already been
given to you. Be sure you understand it. You may use this function as
a template for the other functions you need to write.

Getting Started

You can get the starter files by running the following command:

/comp/15/files/proj_metrosim/setup

Note that you should not manually run cp, but rather run the above program. The files will be copied
for you.
The Reference Implementation

After running the above command, you will have access to a reference implementation of the program
named the_MetroSim. We strongly encourage you to play around with it both to learn what is
expected of your program and to test your your program. We will be comparing your program’s
output to the reference, so be sure that you are adhering to the output format. If the diff command
reports any differences between the output of your implementation and the reference implementation,
then you will lose points on the functional correctness portion of your implementation assessment.
Refer to the Testing section in this document for more information.

The setup script makes a link to the reference implementation rather than your own copy. You
use it exactly the same as you would use any other program, but this will guarantee you always use

upcoming sections which should help clarify the points above. Head back here after reading through
the document to begin designing your solution.

            #1.4 The following is about the implementation of the Train and Stations in the metro simulator program, explaining how passengers are organized into queues based on their destinations.:
<begin>
The Train and The Stations

As stated in the program overview, you are required to implement your train as a list of PassengerQueue
instances (each element of the list is a PassengerQueue). Upon boarding the train, each passenger
is organized into a PassengerQueue based on their destination. See the image below for a visual
representation of the Train.

You may find that you will need to represent “lists” of various data types. For this, we require
that you use std::vector or std::list, since it will greatly reduce how much code you’ll need to
write/rework, although you may need to do a little reading before you get started.

The std::vector and std::list documentation on https://www.cplusplus.com is a great re-
source. If you feel that this reference is too verbose for your taste, feel free to seek out additional
resources. As always, any material that you use (including reused code from this class) should be
noted in the Acknowledgements section of your README.

            #1.5 The following is about the Passenger object interface provided for the metro simulator, outlining the requirements for implementing the print function and the specific output format.:
<begin>
The Passenger

We have provided you with the interface for a Passenger object (within Passenger.h). You must use
this Passenger interface, and you may not modify the contents of Passenger.h besides the header
comment.

You must implement the print function for the Passenger interface within the provided imple-

mentation file (Passenger.cpp). The Passenger print function should format output as follows:

[PASSENGER_ID, ARRIVAL->DEPARTURE]

where

• PASSENGER_ID is the Passenger’s ID (each Passenger receives a unique consecutive id number,

starting at 1).

• ARRIVAL and DEPARTURE are the station numbers of the arrival and departure stations, respec-

tively.

Note: The format in which you print must match the above line exactly. Note that there is a space
between ARRIVAL and the preceding comma, and that when each passenger is printed, there should
be no additional whitespace outside the square brackets. Also note that any boxes surrounding output
text in this document are not to be included in your output - they are just here to help highlight the
text.

<end>
            
            #1.6 The following is about the method to enqueue a passenger into the PassengerQueue, detailing its functionality in the metro simulator program.:
<begin>
• void PassengerQueue::enqueue(const Passenger &passenger)

Inserts a new passenger at the end of the queue.

<end>
            
            #1.7 The following is about the testing process for the metro simulator program, highlighting the need for thorough and incremental testing of the PassengerQueue before proceeding with the MetroSim implementation.:
<begin>
Testing

Test thoroughly and incrementally. You should be sure that your PassengerQueue behaves as
intended before you start implementing your MetroSim. Your program will have many components—
it will be significantly easier to debug issues if you test components as you implement them, rather
than implementing everything then testing at the end.

<end>
            ","For the `PassengerQueue` class, you need to implement at least the following functions based on the interface requirements:

1. `Passenger PassengerQueue::front()` - Returns the front element without removing it.
2. `void PassengerQueue::dequeue()` - Removes the front element from the queue.
3. `void PassengerQueue::enqueue(const Passenger &passenger)` - Inserts a new passenger at the end of the queue.

<begin>
Submitting

Be sure your files have header comments, and that those header comments include your name, the
assignment, the date, and acknowledgements for any help you received (if not already credited in the
README file).

For phase 0, submit your complete metro design checkoff.txt file to the assignment “MetroSim

Design Checkoff” on Gradescope.

For phase 1, you will need to submit the following files:

Passenger.h, Passenger.cpp
PassengerQueue.h, PassengerQueue.cpp
unit_tests.h
README

You should only include other C++ files if your solution to PassengerQueue depends on them. Do
not submit MetroSim.cpp for example. You must submit them using Gradescope to the assignment
proj_metrosim_phase1. Submit these files directly, do not try to submit them in a folder. The
README doesn’t have to be the final README. Just document anything that you feel we should know
about your Passenger, PassengerQueue, or the submission in general.

For the final submission, we don’t know exactly what files your final program will comprise. You

will need to submit at least the following files:

            #1.2 The following is about the submission requirements for the metro simulator project, detailing the need for unit tests and command files.:
<begin>
You must also submit:

• Any unit tests you write for your program. This may be done in a file called unit_tests.h,
using the unit_test framework that we have used on past assignments. Alternatively, you can
create your own testing main functions, e.g., submit a file called MetroSim_tests.cpp with a
main function that calls out to tests. Whatever testing files you use, you must submit them!

• Any command files (excluding the command file provided).

You must submit them using Gradescope to the assignment proj_metrosim. Note, you only need
to include testing input files. For example, input stations or commands files you used. You do not need
to include output files of any kind (stdout, stderr, or the output files you log passenger departures to).

Simulation Overview

Data Abstraction

Your design choices will be of chief importance in this project. It is your responsibility to plan out
how you will build and utilize various components of the simulation. These components include:

• Passengers, which must contain:

◦ an id

◦ a starting station

◦ an ending station

• PassengerQueues, which contain Passengers who are waiting to board or depart from trains.

• A list of Stations.

• the Train, which carries Passengers between Stations.

While it may not be obvious at first how to model these components, we will give you some
guidelines to help you establish the architecture of your MetroSim program. We don’t require every

            #1.4 The following is about Phase One of the metro simulator project, detailing the required implementations of the Passenger and PassengerQueue classes and the importance of thorough testing.:
<begin>
Phase One (Required)

For phase one of this project, you must complete the implementations of Passenger and PassengerQueue,

and you must thoroughly test these classes. See the course calendar for the due date.

<end>
            
            #1.5 The following is about the importance of adhering to the course style guide and ensuring the program builds correctly before submission.:
<begin>
Before submitting your work, please make sure your code and documentation (including sections

of the README) conform to the course style guide.

Be sure your program builds correctly using the commands make and
make MetroSim, because we will use those commands to build your pro-
gram in testing. Be sure to include every file required to compile your
code, along with any tests, and your Makefile and README. You don’t
have to give us the reference implementation. A useful test is to make a
submission directory, copy all your files in there, then run make and see
if the program builds. Test it, then submit everything.

            #1.6 The following is about the required design checkoff process for the metro simulator project, including submission and discussion with TAs.:
<begin>
Design Checkoff (Required)

First, complete the required design checkoff questions given in the starter file metro design checkoff.txt,

and submit your answers on Gradescope under the assignment “MetroSim Design Checkoff.”

You must submit this file prior to meeting with a TA.
Then, go to office hours and talk to a TA about your plan. You should be prepared to discuss the
answers you submitted. You are welcome to bring other materials as well, though you are not required
to: drawings, pseudocode, etc.

The design checkoff helps twofold: you plan out your project and get your brain working on it in the
background, and you also get design feedback before it’s too late. TAs will check off your design, but
reserve the right to not check off your design if they believe your design was not thoroughly mapped
out enough.

Please sign up for a design check off on the form linked here.
Note: it is completely okay to deviate from this initial plan. In fact, we encourage you to continue
to evaluate the structure of your solution and fine-tune it as you go – that’s what programmers do in

            #1.7 The following is about the primary tasks for the assignment, emphasizing the creation of an interactive simulation and the design of an object-oriented approach.:
<begin>
The primary, high-level tasks for this assignment are as follows:

• Create an interactive front-end simulation that works with both files and the command line

• Design and develop an object-oriented approach to solving the back-end logic for the simulation

• Seamlessly connect the front-end and back-end systems

A few words of caution: The training wheels are off! There are some requirements (see below)
for your implementation, but we have given you considerably more freedom to architect your solution
to this problem than in previous assignments. This is a double-edged sword! To succeed, it would
be wise to read the following spec thoroughly and to start designing a solution as early as possible.
This will give you time to go to office hours to discuss your plan with the course staff before you start
coding. This program can be done with less code than the previous assignment if you have designed
your program well.
